    "Continuous electroproduction of formate via CO2 reduction on local symmetry-broken single-atom catalysts\n",
    "Abstract\n",
    "Atomic-level coordination engineering is an efficient strategy for tuning the catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs). However, their rational design has so far been plagued by the lack of a universal correlation between the coordination symmetry and catalytic properties. Herein, we synthesised planar-symmetry-broken CuN3 (PSB-CuN3) SACs through microwave heating for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Remarkably, the as-prepared catalysts exhibited a selectivity of 94.3% towards formate at −0.73 V vs. RHE, surpassing the symmetrical CuN4 catalyst (72.4% at −0.93 V vs. RHE). In a flow cell equipped with a PSB-CuN3 electrode, over 90% formate selectivity was maintained at an average current density of 94.4 mA cm−2 during 100 h operation. By combining definitive structural identification with operando X-ray spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the intrinsic local symmetry breaking from planar D4h configuration induces an unconventional dsp hybridisation, and thus a strong correlation between the catalytic activity and microenvironment of metal centre (i.e., coordination number and distortion), with high preference for formate production in CuN3 moiety. The finding opens an avenue for designing efficient SACs with specific local symmetries for selective electrocatalysis.\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "Formic acid has long been regarded as an important liquid feedstock for valuable chemicals synthesis and ideal hydrogen carrier material owing to its high volumetric (53.4 g L−1) and moderate gravimetric (4.4 wt%) hydrogen storage capacity in ambient conditions1,2. Producing formic acid via the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is therefore attracting widespread attention3,4,5. Considering both the thermodynamical and kinetic energy barriers, the energy consumption for electroreduction of CO2 to formic acid (\n",
    "CO2+2H++2e−→HCOOH\n",
    ", −0.19 V vs. RHE) is relatively less compared with other products like CH3OH and CH4. In the past years, various metals (e.g., Cu, Sn, Bi) and their alloys have been prepared as electrocatalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 to formic acid6,7,8,9,10. Although significant progress has been made in reducing the overpotential for CO2 electroreduction to formic acid11,12,13,14, achieving the necessary faradaic efficiency (FE) and current density for practical applications remains a challenge15,16,17. Hence, there is a pressing demand to develop highly selective and energy-efficient catalysts for the electroreduction of CO2 to formic acid.\n",
    "Carbon-supported single-atom catalysts (SACs), most of which usually adopt a prototypical MN4 moiety with local planar-like D4h symmetry, show great promise for accelerating the kinetics of heterogeneous catalysis owing to their unique physicochemical properties18,19,20. Though substantial progress has been made in activity improvement, recent studies reveal that the highly symmetrical MN4 architecture actually imposes serious limitations on the electronic configuration regulation of the active metal site21,22,23. To lift the confinement and better tune the electronic structures of the active sites, various coordination engineering strategies such as tuning the coordination species and the coordination number of the active centres, heteroatom substitution, neighbouring metal interactions are developed24,25,26,27. For example, the coordination-engineered M-Nx/NxLy (L=C, O, P, S) exhibits excellent performance in oxygen-involved electrocatalysis with a medium bond strength (494 kJ mol−1 for O=O bond)23,28,29,30,31,32,33, and great potentials for activating the molecules with high bond energy such as C=O in CO2 (750 kJ mol−1)34,35,36,37,38,39. Essentially, local symmetry breaking from the planar-like D4h via coordination engineering can redistribute the electronic (anti-)bonding states on specific d/s/p orbitals of the metal sites along with the energy scale and thereby maximumly regulate their hybridisation interaction in a rationally pre-selected local symmetry. This local symmetry manipulation could thus facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecular as well as reactive intermediates and optimise the reaction pathways for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with high activity and selectivity40. Unfortunately, except for the extrinsic addition of various axial ligands, there is no report about the intrinsic local symmetry breaking in M-Nx SACs for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to date. Moreover, despite the extensive endeavours, the underlying mechanism that governs the structure−functionality relationship and the universal design principle to manipulate the local coordination symmetry remains unclear.\n",
    "Herein, the local planar-symmetry-broken CuN3 (PSB-CuN3) SACs were synthesised by a facile and simple microwave process for electroreduction of CO2. The as-prepared PSB-CuN3 delivers a selectivity of 94.3% for electroreduction of CO2 into formate at a potential of −0.73 V vs. RHE, which outperforms the CuN4 SACs with local planar D4h symmetry (PS-CuN4) with a maximum selectivity of 72.4% at a given potential of −0.93 V vs. RHE. Impressively, the flow cell equipped with the PSB-CuN3 electrode exhibits over 90% formate selectivity at an average reduction current density of 94.4 mA cm−2 during 100 h continuous operation at an applied potential of −0.95 V vs. RHE. By combining definitive structural identification with ex-situ/operando X-ray spectroscopy characterisations and systematic theoretical calculations, we reveal that the intrinsic local symmetry breaking from the planar-like D4h to C2v configuration induces an unconventional dsp hybridisation. It causes the catalytic activity unconformable to the widely used d-band centre theory, but strongly correlated with the local environment of the metal centre (i.e., coordination number and geometric distortion), which can serve as a universal descriptor to predict the activities of H2/CO/HCOOH productions for graphene-based SACs, with a high preference for formate production in CuN3 moiety.\n",
    "Results and discussion\n",
    "Synthesis and structural characterisation of PSB-CuN3 catalyst\n",
    "PSB-CuN3 is synthesised via a microwave heating strategy, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. Amine-functionalised graphene nanosheets (AGNs) are used to immobilise the Cu2+ ions through an electrostatic interaction. Then, PSB-CuN3 is obtained through a rapid microwave heating process within five seconds. In comparison to conventional thermal annealing, microwave-induced instant heating leads the local environment in the material to change dramatically, facilitating the formation of a local symmetry-breaking architecture. The ultrathin morphology of as-synthesised PSB-CuN3 can be discerned well by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images, in which the edges of the two dimentional (2D) nanosheets spontaneously curl upon microwave heating (Fig. 1b, c, Supplementary Fig. 1a). The aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (AC-HAADF-STEM) image (Supplementary Fig. 1b) shows that no Cu-derived nanoparticles can be observed, which agrees with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) result (Supplementary Fig. 2). Meanwhile, the atomic dispersion of single Cu atoms can be directly identified as the obvious individual bright dots in the high-magnification AC-HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 1d, e). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings analysis shows C, N and Cu elements are homogeneously dispersed on the entire architecture of PSB-CuN3 (Fig. 1f) with a content of 96.7 at %, 2.82 at % and 0.48 at %, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3). And, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement (Fig. 1g) is performed to present the average thickness of the PSB-CuN3 (~1.61 nm). The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms shows a high specific surface area of ~510 m2 g−1 with dominant pore sizes of ~4 nm (Supplementary Fig. 4). The PS-CuN4 catalyst prepared by conventional thermal annealing shows similar physiochemical information (Supplementary Figs. 2–6), demonstrating the high controllability for materials synthesis. Subsequently, chemical states of the elements in PSB-CuN3 and PS-CuN4 are investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Supplementary Figs. 7–9). While three types of graphitic (401.2 eV), pyrrolic (399.4 eV) and pyridinic (398.6 eV) N species for stabilising the Cu atoms exhibit no obvious difference, the Cu 2p spectrum of PSB-CuN3 possesses two dominant peaks at binding energies of 932.0 eV (2p3/2) and 951.8 eV (2p1/2) that are obviously lower than the characteristic binding energies of 934.3 and 954.1 eV for the Cu2+ in PS-CuN4, implying a lower valence state of Cu1+ in PSB-CuN3. Cu LMM spectra are obtained to further demonstrate the chemical valence of the two samples (Supplementary Fig. 10). While PSB-CuN3 is dominated by Cu1+ species located at 571.1 eV, PS-CuN4 is dominated by Cu2+ species located at 572.0 eV41. In addition to the chemical states, Raman spectra show there are a larger number of structural defects in PSB-CuN3 compared with PS-CuN4 (Supplementary Fig. 11). Thus, the above results suggest that the Cu species in PSB-CuN3 catalyst are likely to be dispersed as unusual low-valent mononuclear centres on largely defective graphene nanosheets.\n",

    "Atomic and electronic structure analysis of PSB-CuN3 catalyst by X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy\n",
    "The coordination environment and chemical state of PSB-CuN3 are further explored by element-selective X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy analysis including extended-XAFS (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). Figure 2a shows the Cu K-edge EXAFS Fourier-transformed (FT) magnitudes. Both PSB-CuN3 and PS-CuN4 exhibit a major peak at ~1.60 Å and a minor satellite peak at ~2.20 Å, which is similar to the archetypical profile of pyridinic-N-based MN4C4 motifs21. Concurrently, the EXAFS wavelet-transform analysis is performed to more clearly discriminate the coordination atoms42. Only one intensity maximum at ~4.2 Å–1 is detected in the two catalysts (Fig. 2b), which confirms the assignment of the major and minor peaks to the Cu–N/C bonding (Supplementary Fig. 12a). However, the two peaks intensities in PSB-CuN3 are obviously weaker than that in PS-CuN4 (Supplementary Fig. 12b), which implies a lower coordination configuration for Cu atoms in PSB-CuN3. Subsequently, quantitative EXAFS curve-fitting analysis is carried out to investigate the coordination configuration (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Figs. 13–17; Supplementary Table 1). Coordination numbers of the first N and second C coordination spheres in PS-CuN4 are estimated to be 4.0 and 4.1 at distances of 2.00 and 2.67 Å, respectively, supporting the adoption of a pyridinic-N-based CuN4C4 configuration (Supplementary Fig. 17c). By contrast, the best-fit for PSB-CuN3 demonstrates reduced coordination numbers (2.8 for Cu–N and 2.9 for Cu–C) with contracted interatomic distances (1.98 Å for the first Cu–N and 2.65 Å for Cu–C) for the first and second coordination spheres, suggesting a defective pyridinic-N-based CuN3C3 configuration (Fig. 2c).\n",

    "Due to the higher sensitivity to the 3D arrangement of atoms around the photo-absorber, XANES spectroscopy is applied to better identify the atomic-site structures43,44. Figure 2d shows the hard Cu K-edge XANES spectra for the samples along with references. The PS-CuN4 exhibits a shoulder feature B at ~8987 eV, which is close to that of Cu(NO3)2. It arises from the 1s→4pz transition of a planar-like Cu2+ configuration45,46. However, in the spectrum of PSB-CuN3, a pronounced peak A is observed at a much lower energy of ~8982 eV as in Cu2O, signifying an unusual Cu1+ configuration. Moreover, PSB-CuN3 shows a more flattened profile for the post-edge features C, D and E compared with PS-CuN4. This tendency is also corroborated by the soft XANES results (Supplementary Figs. 18–20). And, the Cu L3,2-edge spectra reveal an emergence of two extra post-edge resonant peaks from PS-CuN4 to PSB-CuN3 that coincides with the positions of Cu2O (Supplementary Fig. 20). Those hard and soft XANES differences indicate a peculiar Cu1+ species in PSB-CuN3 and a planar-like Cu2+ species in PS-CuN4, consistent with the XPS results (Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10). Then, as guided by the EXAFS results, we constructed various CuNxCy structural models with different local symmetry (Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22) and resorted to XANES simulation to identify the specific configuration. Figure 2e, f shows that the CuN4C4 moiety with local D4h symmetry (Note: The C4 symmetry axis is perpendicular to the plane) reproduces properly the experimental K- and L3,2-edge XANES profiles of PS-CuN4. In addition, when a N defect is introduced, the obtained CuN3C3 moiety shows a local symmetry breaking from D4h to C2v (Note: The remaining C2 symmetry axis is in the plane) and it produces an excellent agreement to the experimental profiles of PSB-CuN3, particularly for the characteristic peaks A and D at K-edge (Fig. 2e) and for the peaks F’ and G’ at L3,2-edge (Fig. 2f). By contrast, more N defects in CuN2C2 moiety lead to a dramatic discrepancy in the profiles (see Supplementary Fig. 23). The probability for the substitution of the N atoms in the first coordination sphere by C atoms can also be excluded (Supplementary Figs. 24 and 25, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note 1). Therefore, the combination of EXAFS and XANES analyses has unambiguously revealed a dominance of defective CuN3C3 moiety with lower local C2v symmetry and mono-valence implanted in a graphene sheet for PSB-CuN3 catalyst.\n",
    "Because the K-edge (1s→4p transition) and L3,2-edge (2p→3d transition) XANES can probe the unoccupied density of states on the 4p and 3d orbitals of the Cu sites, the emergent resonant features (A, F’ and G’) in PSB-CuN3 catalyst indicate a unique p and d electronic distribution that can be regulated by the local coordination symmetry. Detailed analysis on the density of states (Fig. 2g–i, Supplementary Figs. 26 and 27 and Supplementary Note 2) unveils that the local symmetry lowering from D4h in CuN4C4 to C2v in CuN3C3 can drive an obvious upshift of the anti-bonding 4 s and 4p state to above the Fermi energy and finally trigger a dramatic dsp hybridisation at the energy positions of peaks A/F/G and F’/G’, where the p orbital is dominated by the in-plane px/py orbital. The local symmetry lowering to C2v in CuN2C2 promotes a dsp2 hybridisation with the p orbital arising mainly from the in-plane px and py orbitals (Supplementary Fig. 28 and Supplementary Note 2). Accordingly, those anti-bonding state upshifts induced by local symmetry breaking in defective CuNxCy moieties can be pivotal to modifying the adsorption strength of the reactive intermediates and thus optimise the reaction pathways for CO2RR with high activity and selectivity.\n",
    "Evaluation of CO2RR performance\n",
    "The intrinsic CO2RR activity of the as-prepared samples was performed in a gas-tight H-type cell by coating a thin electrocatalyst layer on the carbon fibre paper with a catalyst loading of 0.5 mg cm−2. The electrolytes pH (pH = 7.3 for CO2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO3) and the potential of the reference electrode were checked before the test to ensure the reliability of the as-obtained electrochemical results (Supplementary Figs. 29 and 30). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) is employed to obtain polarisation curves of PSB-CuN3, PS-CuN4 and AGNs electrodes in the Ar and CO2 saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 aqueous solution. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 31, the reduction current increases greatly when the electrolyte solution is saturated with CO2. Supplementary Fig. 32 shows a sharp increased cathode current response started at an onset potential of −0.41 V vs. RHE observed from the PSB-CuN3 electrode. By contrast, PS-CuN4 exhibits an onset potential (−0.72 V vs. RHE) under identical conditions. Further, chronoamperometric measurements were carried out at different potentials to quantitively identify product distributions using online gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 35 and Supplementary Table 3, formate is the only liquid product from the CO2RR, with a certain amount of gaseous products including methane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen. No other C1 and C2 liquids (i.e., methanol, ethanol, n-propanol and acetone) were detected (Supplementary Fig. 34). Impressive FEs (HCOO−) (>90%) were obtained with the PSB-CuN3 throughout the potential range (−0.75 to −1.0 V vs. RHE). On the contrary, the maximal FEs of formate for PS-CuN4 and AGNs electrodes are 72.4% and 9.5% under identical testing conditions. This suggests the PSB-CuN3 moiety should be responsible for the high selectivity for formate. Besides, chronoamperometric measurement was carried out to investigate the stability of the as-prepared PSB-CuN3. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 36, the FE of the PSB-CuN3 electrode is ~92% after 16 h electrocatalysis compared with PS-CuN4 (~27%). To investigate CO2 reduction performance under industrial level current of PSB-CuN3, a flow cell equipped with gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) was fabricated (Supplementary Fig. 37). Figure 3a shows that the GDE with PSB-CuN3 could be operated at a current density of 150 mA cm−2, with modest overpotentials in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution, which is much higher than the PS-CuN4 under the same applied potential. The optimal FEs of PSB-CuN3 electrode is 97.9%, which is higher than the PS-CuN4 (78.8%) (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 4). With this FE, a CO2RR to formate partial current density of ~62 mA cm−2 was achieved (Fig. 3c). Moreover, the FE of PSB-CuN3 for HCOO− can be maintained over 90% through a wide applied potential range from −0.65 to −0.97 V vs. RHE (Fig. 3d, e), exhibiting excellent selectivity for CO2RR-to-formate. It should be stressed that both the selectivity and activity of the PSB-CuN3 are comparable to the previously best-reported CO2RR-to-HCOO− catalysts (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Table 5). Turnover frequency (TOF), as a key parameter for CO2RR efficiency assessment, is then calculated based on the standard equation. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 38, the maximum TOF value of PSB-CuN3 is 30825.3 h−1 at a given potential of −1.1 V vs. RHE, considerably higher than PS-CuN4 (8558.8 h−1) and is comparable to the recently best-reported CO2RR-to-HCOO− catalysts (Supplementary Table 5). To show the scalability of the as-fabricated flow cell with PSB-CuN3 electrode, the long-term durability was tested under the large current density. As shown in Fig. 3g, the PSB-CuN3 electrode maintains an average current density of 94.4 mA cm−2 with over 90% FEformate during 100 h testing. By contrast, the PS-CuN4 electrode shows 58.3% of the initial reduction current of 25 mA cm−2 with an average FE of 68% (Supplementary Fig. 39). Further structural stability characterisation by AC-HAADF-STEM and XAFS suggest that the Cu atom and its coordinating matrix in PSB-CuN3 are robust enough to withstand the CO2RR operation condition (see below detailed discussion). Thus, the PSB-CuN3 electrode could be readily incorporated into practical CO2RR electrolysers because of its high activity, selectivity and durability at large current densities.\n",

    "Mechanism of CO2 activation and reduction by first-principles calculation and operando spectroscopies\n",
    "To understand the origin of high efficiency toward formate generation on PSB-CuN3 catalyst, first-principles calculations were carried out for the electroreduction process of CO2 on various graphene-based CuNxCy structures. We considered the reaction pathways for CO, formate, methanol and methane productions as well as the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the formation of intermediate *OCHO/*COOH, two mechanisms were considered, i.e., a reaction with *H via a CO2 insertion reaction into the metal–hydrogen bond and a direct protonation with H+ from solution47,48. The optimised structures of the intermediates and the Gibbs free-energy diagrams at zero electrode potential show remarkable response to the coordination environment (Supplementary Figs. 40–47, Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). On the CuN4C4 and CuN3C3 structures, the different adsorbed states of *COO− and *OCO− for CO2 via the first electron addition are suggested to be the potential limiting steps for CO and formate productions, respectively, and the *OCO− formation is more energetically favoured than *COO−. By contrast, on the CuN2C2 structure, the potential limiting steps shift to the desorption of CO and formate. The pathways initiated by *H adsorption do not show any preference than the pathways initiated by *COO−/*OCO− adsorption. It is well documented that the reduction of CO2 to CH4 and CH3OH shares similar pathways until the formation of *CO intermediate, and the potential limiting steps are shown to be \n",

    " for CuN4C4, \n",
    "∗CO→∗CHO\n",
    " for CuN3C3 and CuN2C2 (Supplementary Fig. 47). The magnitudes of the corresponding theoretical limiting free-energy differences (ΔGL) are summarised in Supplementary Fig. 47. While the three distinctly coordinated catalysts exhibit a flipped volcano relationship for CO and formate activities, the predicted HER and CH4/CH3OH activities are simultaneously enhanced by lowering the local symmetry via introducing N vacancy. In comparison to the highly symmetrical CuN4C4, it leads to a much lower ΔGL (0.23 eV) for the formate pathway than the CO (0.68 eV), CH4/CH3OH (0.78 eV) and HER (1.01 eV) pathways in the local symmetry-broken CuN3C3. But, this tendency is reversed by more N vacancies in CuN2C2 which exhibits a preference to the HER pathway. The high selectivity for CO2 conversion to formate in CuN3C3 can be also appreciated from the large difference between the ΔGL for CO2 reduction and HER. The probability for C2 products generation was also considered by examining the first C–C coupling of two *CO species that is crucial for the formation of C2 products (Supplementary Fig. 47). This step is found to have a large ΔGL (1.79 eV on CuN4C4 and 1.67 eV on CuN3C3), indicating a formidable C–C coupling of *CO species for the generation of C2 products. Thus, the HCOOH production is thermodynamically preferred than the generation of other C1 and C2 products and H2 on the CuN3C3 structure at zero electrode potential.\n",
    "Because the electric field can interact with intermediates with a substantial dipole moment and/or polarizability49,50,51, we further examined the effects of interfacial electric field and pH on the adsorbate bindings on different CuNxCy structures (Supplementary Table 7). A significant response of the adsorbate bonding strength to the electric field effects is revealed in Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 48. Then, an applied potential of −0.80 V vs. RHE and pH = 7.3 is considered and it leads to a remarkable decrease of the free energy for the adsorbates (Fig. 4b–e, Supplementary Figs. 49 and 50), which indicates more stabilised intermediates and decreased endothermicity for the reaction steps. On the CuN3C3 structure, the potential limiting steps for formate and CO productions are shifted to \n",

    " and CO desorption, respectively (Fig. 4b), and it produces a considerably lower limiting free-energy difference (ΔGL) of −0.03 eV for the formate pathway (Fig. 4e), which is in contrast to the comparable ΔGL between the HER (0.51 eV), CO (0.63 eV) and CH4/CH3OH (0.51 eV) pathways, indicating a strong preference to the formate production. By contrast, a much higher ΔGL of 0.62 eV is shown for the formate pathway on the CuN4C4 structure. This prediction agrees well with the impressively higher FE for CO2RR-to-formate on PSB-CuN3 catalyst than on PS-CuN4 catalyst over similar potential range (see Fig. 3). CuN2C2 exhibits an extremely strong preference to the HER pathway with a ΔGL of −0.68 eV. Similar potential dependence is obtained at an applied potential of −0.40 V vs. RHE (Supplementary Table 7). All in all, the adsorbate energies corrected for the electric field and pH effects strongly support the highest activity and selectivity toward formate in the local symmetry-broken CuN3C3 moiety.\n",

    "To understand why the modified electronic structure in PSB-CuN3 catalyst is in favour of CO2 reduction toward formate, the projected density of states for the adsorbed intermediates of *COO− and *OCO− were obtained. Supplementary Fig. 51 shows the overlap degree between Cu-d and O-p orbitals is generally larger than that between Cu-d and C-p orbitals on each CuNxCy structure, thus indicating a stronger binding of *OCO− than *COO−. For *OCO−, the overlap degree between Cu-d and O-p orbitals in CuN3C3 and CuN2C2 is obviously increased as compared to CuN4C4. However, the binding of the intermediates in CuN2C2 is so strong that the potential limiting step shifts to the formate desorption. It suggests that the local symmetry-broken CuN3C3 can produce a suitable overlap degree between the Cu-d and O-p orbitals, which can result in a neither strong nor weak binding of the intermediates. Thus, those results unveil that the highest activity and selectivity toward formate in the local symmetry-broken CuN3C3 moiety is strongly correlated with its unusual coordination environment, in good agreement with the experimentally detected excellent activity of the PSB-CuN3 catalyst in electrochemical CO2 reduction (Fig. 3).\n",

    "The intrinsic coordination characteristics of the active CuNx centres that dominate the adsorbate binding strength and activity are explored. Breaking of the local D4h symmetry to create planar-like CuN3 and CuN2 moieties with lower local C2v symmetry leads to charge redistribution (Fig. 4f) and increased attractive interactions for the intermediates (Fig. 4b–e). The charge redistribution is first manifested as an obvious upshift of the d-band centre of Cu atom in energy relative to the Fermi level from CuN4 to CuN3 moiety, but this tendency is reversed by a dramatic downshift of the d-band centre in CuN2 moiety (Supplementary Fig. 52a). This anomaly leads to the widely used d-band centre model cannot correlate with the increased adsorbate binding strength and activity (Supplementary Fig. 52b, c), which stems from the enhanced dsp orbitals hybridisation near the Fermi level in local symmetry-broken CuNx moieties (Supplementary Fig. 53) as also indicated by experimental XANES results. By contrast, the total electron transfer from Cu and the work function appear to be dominated by the coordination number of nearest-neighbour N atoms (denoted as nN, Supplementary Fig. 54a–c), which matches well with the valence state change obtained by XANES. In addition, approximate linear relationships are observed when nN is plotted against adsorption energies and limiting free-energy differences for different intermediates (Supplementary Fig. 54d, e), which suggests that nN can be a significant factor of the descriptor52. Besides, it is noted that angular distortion has been widely used to describe the stereochemical activity of ns2 electron pairs in metal halide perovskites ABX353. It suggests that the angle distortion between neighbouring Cu–N bonds in the present work can further modify the charge redistribution and binding affinity, and we add it as an additional factor to modify the descriptor as follows:\n",
    "φ=𝑛𝑁×(1−1𝑛𝑎∑{𝑖=1}𝑛𝑎|90−𝛼𝑖90|)\n",
    "(1)\n",
    "where nN is the number of nearest-neighbour N atoms, αi is the N–Cu–N bond angle between neighbouring Cu–N bonds and na is the number of the N–Cu–N bond angles. As shown in Fig. 4g, Supplementary Fig. 55 and Supplementary Table 8, excellent linearity is obtained between φ and the adsorption energies for *COO−, *OCO−, *COOH, *OCHO and *H. It means that a decrease in φ corresponds to an enhancement in binding strength, which particularly causes a tighter binding of *COO−, *OCO−, *COOH, *OCHO and *H. This can be attributed to the adoption of a peculiar slant adsorption way (instead of the conventional top-site way, see Fig. 4f) of *OCHO intermediate on the CuNx centres with the successive introduction of N vacancy. It leads to an unusual coupling between the in-plane and out-of-plane 3d, 4s and 4p orbitals of the Cu centre and the 2s and 2p orbitals of the bonded O atom of intermediates (Fig. 4f, Supplementary Figs. 56–58). It suggests that the orbital coupling degree and binding affinity between the Cu centre and the intermediates is directly correlated with the local geometric symmetry breaking of the surrounding N atoms (Supplementary Note 3). Figure 4h shows the theoretical limiting free-energy differences versus the descriptor φ. While a good linearity with different slopes is shown for H2 production, a flipped volcano relationship is revealed for CO, formate and CH4/CH3OH productions, with the CuN3 moiety lying at bottom of the volcano. The relative order of activity and selectivity from the theoretical prediction reproduces well the experiment data (Fig. 3), thus validating our descriptor φ. Hence, the local coordination symmetry breaking, which is quantified as a combination of nearest-neighbour coordination number and bond angle distortion, can serve as a universal descriptor to evaluate the activity of graphene-based single Cu catalysts towards CO2RR.\n",
    "The dynamic processes for CO2 adsorption and activation towards highly selective production of formate on PSB-CuN3 were further investigated by experimental Cu K-edge XAFS spectroscopy under operando conditions (Fig. 4i, Supplementary Figs. 59–66, Supplementary Table 1). The XANES spectra display that the Cu K-edge of pristine PSB-CuN3 initially shifts to higher energy and the intensity of the shoulder peak D also increases when immersing in CO2-saturated 0.5 M KHCO3 solution under open-circuit potential (OCP) bias (Supplementary Fig. 59a). This indicates an increased oxidation state for the Cu sites, which is caused by the charge transferred from low-valent Cu1+ to CO2 molecule to form CO2δ+ species. This assumption is consistent with a slight contraction of the first major peak from 1.60 Å to 1.58 Å as well as an elongation of the second satellite peak from 2.20 Å to 2.26 Å in EXAFS-FT under OCP bias (Fig. 4i). It reflects an additional contribution from the Cu–O bond of the dynamically adsorbed CO2 molecular. During CO2 reduction at −0.5 V and −0.8 V vs. RHE, the Cu K-edge XANES shows a shift back to lower energy without obvious profile change, which indicates the adoption of a low oxidation state for the Cu sites during the catalytic stage, corroborating the high activation ability of CuN3C3 centres for CO2 reduction. Meanwhile, the first two peaks in EXAFS-FT, which now consists of the Cu–N bonds and the Cu–O/C bonds from the reaction intermediates (e.g., *OCO−, *OCHO), demonstrates a continuous shift to shorter length and an increase in intensity (Fig. 4i), corresponding to a contraction of Cu–N/O/C bonds with decreased bond disorder. When the applied potential returns to OCP, both XANES and EXAFS-FT reverse to the initial OCP state. Further quantitative EXAFS curve-fitting analysis reveals a decrease in Cu-N/O/C interatomic distances as well as an increase in coordination numbers during the operating process (Supplementary Fig. 63 and Supplementary Table 1). Similar evolution behaviours for the electronic and atomic structures of the metal centres under the catalytic conditions have also been observed in single-Ni-atom catalyst for CO2 reduction to CO54. Here, the above phenomena consolidate a tighter binding of the reaction intermediates (e.g., *OCO−, *OCHO) under the catalytic conditions, which is suggested to be responsible for the high catalytic activity and selectivity of the PSB-CuN3.\n",
    "At the same time, attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infra-red absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) was used to probe the reaction intermediates on PSB-CuN3 (Supplementary Fig. 67). When the applied potential is more negative than −0.8 V vs. RHE, the obvious peak at ~1620 cm–1 exhibits a pronounced rise and red shift, which can be ascribed to the asymmetrical O–C–O stretching band of dissolved formate. Additionally, two broad bands appeared between 1450 and 1350 cm–1, and they can be assigned to the symmetrical O–C–O stretching mode of bridge-bonded formate and the C–OH vibration of desorbed formate molecules, respectively55. No signal of *COO−/*COOH was detected. These findings evidence the preferred formation of *OCO−/*OCHO intermediates bonded to the PSB-CuN3 catalyst via O.\n",
    "The impact on the catalytic and structural stability from N coordination number variation is investigated (See detailed discussion in Supplementary Note 4). While PSB-CuN3 shows better electrocatalytic stability than PS-CuN4 in both H-cell and flow cell under the same applied potential, the detailed operando and postmortem XAFS with AC-HAADF-STEM characterisations revealed a structural reconstruction occurs on both PSB-CuN3 and PS-CuN4 during CO2 reduction. Compared with PS-CuN4 with high valence Cu2+, the structure change of low-valent Cu1+ PSB-CuN3 is slight. And, the structural evolution process of PSB-CuN3 is reversible and no atoms aggregation can be observed after CO2 electrocatalysis. On contrary, the dramatic structural reconstruction of PS-CuN4 leads to an irreversible aggregation of fractional Cu atoms. Therefore, the electrochemical stability of PSB-CuN3 is better than that of PS-CuN4, consistent with previous works that the low-valent Ni1+ single-atom catalysts showed no reconstruction into nanoparticles for CO2RR to CO54, but the high-valent Cu2+ single-atom catalysts reconstructed to nanoparticles in the electrochemical reduction of nitrate to ammonia56 and electrocatalytic oxygen reduction57.\n",
    "In summary, the local planar-symmetry-broken PSB-CuN3 is successfully prepared by a simple and facile method, and further used as the electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Significantly, the as-prepared PSB-CuN3 catalyst exhibits extremely high electrocatalytic activity and catalytic stability in both H-cell and flow cell systems, superior to the highly symmetrical PS-CuN4 and comparable to recently best-reported CO2RR-to-HCOO− catalysts. By combining ex-situ/operando EXAFS, XANES and ATR-SEIRAS analyses with theoretical calculations, we unambiguously unveiled that the high catalytic performance for formate production originates from the intrinsic local symmetry breaking from the planar-like D4h to C2v configuration in PSB-CuN3, such that an unconventional dsp hybridisation is emerged. With this anomaly, the catalytic activities are unconformable to the widely used d-band centre theory, whereas the local environment of the metal centre including coordination number and geometric distortion is identified as a newly universal descriptor to the intermediate adsorption and thus catalytic activities for H2/CO/HCOOH/CH4/CH3OH productions in graphene-based SACs. Our study provides a universal and efficient guideline for the rational design and accurate modulation of the active centre’s local symmetry in nonprecious metal SACs for diverse CO2RR applications at the atomic scale.\n",

    "1. Introduction\n",
    "Ammonia (NH3), as an important raw material for fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and chemical industries, is also considered a renewable energy carrier with the advantages of no carbon, high energy density (22.5 MJ kg−1), and easy liquefaction [1], [2], [3]. Moreover, the conventional Haber–Bosch (H–B) process has dominated the synthetic ammonia industry and contributed to the rapid growth of the global population over the past century [4]. However, the H-B process requires high temperatures (400–500 °C) and high pressures (100–200 atm) to convert nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2) into ammonia, resulting in annual energy consumption of about 5.5 EJ and greenhouse gas emissions of more than 450 million metric tons [5], [6]. Due to the above defects of the H–B process, electrochemical N2 reduction to NH3 using H2O instead of H2 as a proton source has recently attracted significant attention owing to its mild reaction conditions [7], [8]. Even so, the high dissociation energy of the Ntriple bondN bond (941 kJ mol−1) and limited water solubility of N2 leads to the aqueous-based N2 reduction reaction suffering from inferior efficiency and yield [9], [10], [11]. In contrast, nitrate (NO3-) is more active than N2 for NH3 production due to the relatively lower dissociation energy of the N = O bond (204 kJ mol−1), outstanding solubility, and favorable thermodynamic potential (0.69 V vs. RHE) [12]. Meanwhile, abundant NO3- ions from agricultural and industrial discharge into the global hydrological environment may result in a series of hazards such as human diseases, eutrophication, ecosystem disruption, and even the imbalanced global nitrogen cycle [13], [14], [15]. Therefore, the reduction of NO3- to NH3 can promote the solution of environmental problems caused by NO3- pollution and hopefully can be an alternative to the traditional ammonia synthesis process.\n",
    "Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia reaction involves a nine-proton coupled eight-electron transfer process, which obviously lowers the kinetic rate and leads to complex intermediates (e.g., NO2-) [12], [16], [17], [18]. Moreover, the sluggish kinetic rate results in a considerable overpotential of NO3RR, and thus the practical working potentials of NO3RR are considerably overlaid with that of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) [19], [20], [21], [22]. Therefore, the fierce competition between water/protons and reactants is inevitable during electrochemical NO3RR. To this end, tremendous efforts have been devoted to tailoring structures of electrocatalysts from nano to atomic scale [23], [24], [25], [26]. Compared with nanocatalysts, single-atom catalysts (SACs) demonstrate great potential in NO3--to-NH3 conversion due to their maximum atomic utilization efficiency, unsaturated coordination environment, and tunable electronic structure [27], [28]. Copper-based catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity for NO3RR since Cu atoms with 3d10 orbital are more favorable for NO3- adsorption [29], [30]. Recently, N-doped carbon-based materials are used to anchor copper to achieve uniform dispersion of Cu atoms, serving as Cu-N-C single-atom catalysts [31], [32], [33], [34]. Benefiting from the tunable structure of Cu-N-C SACs, regulating the local coordination environment of the Cu atom is an effective way to optimize the catalytic performance. Some previous reports have made substantial efforts to tune the metal-N-C construction from various dimensions including coordination number, first-shell and second-shell heteroatom doping, dual metal sites, and inter-site distance [24], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. Besides, direct regulation of the metal-coordinated N structure is a recently developed strategy, which has been studied in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) [40], [41]. However, for the NO3RR, the effect of the N structure on the selectivity of NH3 and the competing HER is still unclear.\n",
    "Herein, we report a pyridinic-N-rich coordinated copper single-atom catalyst (PR-CuNC) derived from three-dimensional (3D) semi-interpenetrating polypyrrole-polyethyleneimine (PPy-PEI) hydrogels with adsorbing Cu ions. Without introducing PEI, the structure of coordinated N was transformed to the relatively low pyridinic-N coordinated Cu (CuNC). PR-CuNC exhibits impressive Faraday efficiency of 94.61 % and a yield rate of 130.71 mgNH3 mgCu−1 h−1 for electrocatalytic NO3RR, while the activity of CuNC is unsatisfactory. Theoretical evidence suggests that the electronic structure change originating from the Cu-N configuration is responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance. The favorable NO3- adsorption and the lower energy barrier in the nitrate-to-ammonia reduction reaction of Cu-pyridinic-N4 further support the experimental phenomenon from a thermodynamic perspective. The findings in this work highlight a new way to directly regulate the local nitrogen coordination environment for optimizing NO3RR activity at the molecular level.\n",
    "2. Experimental\n",
    "2.1. Preparation of PEI-PPy hydrogels and PPy hydrogels\n",
    "The semi-interpenetrating PEI-PPy hydrogels were prepared by the polymerization of pyrrole by introducing PEI in this strategy. Briefly, pyrrole monomers (0.3 M, 416 μL), PEI (0.101 g), and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS, 0.1 M, 0.697 g) were dissolved in HCl aqueous solutions (1.0 M, 10 mL) and marked as solution A. Solution B was prepared by adding ammonium persulphate (APS, 0.3 M, 1.397 g) in HCl aqueous solutions (1.0 M, 10 mL). After cooling to 2 °C, the above two solutions were rapidly mixed and left overnight at 2 °C to ensure complete polymerization. Finally, the as-prepared PEI-PPy hydrogels were alternately washed with deionized (DI) water and anhydrous ethanol several times to eliminate unreacted residual impurities and by-products. As a comparison, PPy hydrogels were also prepared in a similar process, in which PEI was absent in solution A.\n",
    "2.2. Preparation of PR-CuNC and CuNC\n",
    "The purified PEI-PPy hydrogels were added into copper chloride (0.2 M) aqueous solution with a continuous stirring for 12 h. Then, the PEI-PPy hydrogels with copper anions were washed several times with DI water and were treated by a freeze-drying process. Afterward, the obtained samples were ground into uniform powders and then calcined at 800 °C under flowing argon (Ar) for 2 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. After naturally cooling to room temperature, the powder products were further immersed in HCl solution (0.5 M) for 4 h at 80 °C to remove the unstable and inactivated copper clusters and particles. The samples were subsequently washed with DI water until the pH value reached 7 and dried in a vacuum at 80 °C. A second calcination was conducted under the same conditions and finally produced PR-CuNC. In contrast, CuNC was prepared via the same process for PR-CuNC unless PPy hydrogels were used. The catalyst (denoted as NC) derived from PPy-PEI hydrogel was prepared following the same process except for the absence of Cu ions adsorption.\n",
    "2.3. Characterization\n",
    "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Helios G4 UC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained with a JEOL NEOARM probe-corrected transmission electron microscope with aberration correction (Japan). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded with a Rigaku Ultima IV X-ray diffraction system (Japan) using Cu Ka radiation (40 kV / 40 mA, 10° min−1 from 5° to 90°). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired with Thermo Scientific K-Alpha (USA); all binding energies were referenced to the C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV to correct the possible shift. X-ray absorption fine structure analysis (XAFS) based on synchrotron radiation was conducted at the BL14W1 beamline of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (China). The corresponding X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were processed by using the IFEFFIT program package. The content of copper in the samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Agilent 5110, USA). Ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi UV-2900 spectrophotometer (Japan). An online gas chromatography (GC 9790 II, FULI, China) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to monitor the gaseous products. All 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra were collected on a Bruker Avance NEO 600 MHz (GER) with water suppression.\n",
    "2.4. Electrochemical measurements\n",
    "Electrochemical measurements were conducted on a DH7003 potentiostat (Donghua test, China) equipped with an H-type quartz electrochemical cell separated by Nafion 115 membrane. Before all tests, the Nafion 115 membranes with a size of 3.5 cm × 3.5 cm were immersed in hydrogen peroxide solution (5 %) at 80 °C for 1 h and ultrapure water at 80 °C for another 1 h, respectively. The hydrophobic carbon paper was soaked in ethanol and DI water for 15 min with ultrasound treatment to remove surface impurities. The catalyst ink was prepared by adding 3 mg catalyst powder and 20 μL Nafion solution (5 wt%, Dupont, USA) into the mixture of DI water (360 μL) and isopropyl alcohol (120 μL) with ultrasonic treatment for 30 mins. Subsequently, homogeneous catalyst ink (20 μL) was drop-cast on hydrophobic carbon paper with an active area of 0.25 cm2 and a mass loading of 0.48 mg cm−2. After the other side of the carbon paper without loading catalysts was sealed with an insulating hot-melt adhesive, the final working electrode was made. In addition, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE, 1 M KCl) and a graphite rod were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. All potentials referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrodes (RHE) were obtained by the following calibration equation: E(RHE) = E(SCE) + 0.059 × pH + 0.253 V. Prior to electrochemical measurements, pure Ar-gas flow was injected into the 0.1 M KOH with or without 0.1 M NO3- electrolytes for 30 mins to remove oxygen and nitrogen. All electrodes were activated by conducting cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests from +0.5 V to –0.9 V vs. RHE for 10 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were acquired from + 0.5 to –0.9 V vs. RHE at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The current-time (I-t) curves were recorded by the chronoamperometry methods, which were performed at different given potentials for 30 mins and the corresponding electrolytes were collected to calculate the yield rate and Faraday efficiency of NH3. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at –0.2 V vs. RHE from 105 to 10−1 Hz.\n",
    "3. Results and discussion\n",
    "3.1. The preparation and characterization\n",
    "PR-CuNC was prepared through the pyrolysis of the PPy-PEI hydrogels with adsorbing Cu ions as illustrated in Scheme 1. Specifically, PEI was introduced in the polymerization of pyrrole to form PPy-PEI hydrogels, where PPy chains were uniformly interpenetrated with PEI chains. Benefiting from abundant primary and secondary amine groups of PEI, PPy-PEI hydrogels show the enhanced capability to anchor Cu ions compared with PPy only. However, the N site (-+NH-) on the pyrrole five-membered ring is the only source of active N sites in PPy and is not conducive to anchoring metal atoms. Cross-linking pyrrole with PEI effectively improved scarce nitrogen active sites and provided diverse coordination environments. Besides, PPy-PEI hydrogels possess a unique 3D semi-interconnected nanostructure with abundant N sites and large surface area, facilitating Cu ions adsorption and preventing aggregated Cu particles during subsequent carbonization. Finally, copper-adsorbed PPy-PEI hydrogels were calcined to produce a PR-CuNC in which the highly dispersed Cu atoms were anchored on the hydrogel-derived carbon substrate.\n",

    "Scheme 1. The synthetic route of the PR-CuNC.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Fig. 1a, the PR-CuNC possesses a porous granular structure composed of interconnected nanoparticles, which is similar to that of CuNC and NC (Fig. S1). In Fig. S2, the XRD pattern of PR-CuNC displays a broad peak at 25.6° corresponding to the (002) plane of graphitic carbon, while no diffraction peaks from Cu-based crystal phases are observed. Thus, there are no aggregated Cu-based compounds existing in PR-CuNC, and Cu species are mainly amorphous. Additionally, CuNC shows similar XRD features as PR-CuNC (Fig. S2). Besides, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of PR-CuNC (240.58 m2 g−1) is similar to that of CuNC (277.72 m2 g−1, Table S1). Based on the above characterization results, it can be concluded that the introduction of PEI has little effect on the morphology and crystal plane structures, eliminating the influence of carbon substrate on material properties. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) with aberration correction was carried out to identify the distribution of atoms. As depicted in Fig. 1b, the HAADF-STEM image of PR-CuNC exhibits light spots dispersed on the edge and surface of the carbon substrate. Since the atom mass of the Cu element is much larger than that of other elements (C, N, O, see the XPS results in Fig. S3) in the catalyst, it can be determined that the light spots represent isolated Cu single atoms. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping analysis further confirms the homogeneous dispersion of Cu, N, and C elements in PR-CuNC, suggesting that Cu atoms were uniformly distributed on the nitrogen-doped carbon substrate.\n",

    "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was conducted to determine the elemental composition and valence state of catalysts. According to XPS survey spectra (Fig. S3), the elemental composition and atomic ratios of PR-CuNC, CuNC, and NC were confirmed and summarized in Table S2. The atomic ratio of the N element in PR-CuNC is 8.21 % higher than that in CuNC (6.48 %), which can be attributed to the presence of PEI with rich amine groups. As shown in Fig. 1d, the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectra for PR-CuNC and CuNC can be deconvoluted into four peaks ascribed to pyridinic-N (398.2 eV), pyrrolic-N (399.3 eV), graphite-N (400.8 eV) and oxidized-N (401.7 eV) [41], [42], [43]. The N 1s XPS spectrum of NC is depicted in Fig. S4. The percentages of four nitrogen species are summarized in Table S3 and S4, where PR-CuNC and CuNC both show similar contents of graphite-N and oxidized-N. However, the absolute content of pyridinic-N on PR-CuNC is 3.20 % exceeding that on CuNC (1.99 %), while PR-CuNC shows a lower absolute content of pyrrolic-N (0.76 %) than CuNC (1.16 %). It suggests that the introduction of PEI successfully boosts the pyridinic-N ratio, forming more Cu-pyridinic-N coordination configuration in PR-CuNC. For the Cu 2p XPS spectrum, PR-CuNC (Fig. S5a) exhibits double characteristic peaks of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2, which both are deconvoluted into two peaks corresponding to Cu2+ species (934.55 and 954.40 eV) and Cu1+/Cu0 species (932.40 and 952.14 eV) [44]. The Cu 2p XPS spectrum for CuNC in Fig. S5b shows similar peaks assigned to Cu2+ and Cu1+/Cu0, respectively [45]. The accurate Cu content is further determined by inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) in Table S5, where PR-CuNC (6.01 wt%) is higher than CuNC (3.69 wt%) probably owing to the strong binding ability of PEI.\n",
    "Due to the accuracy of XPS being insufficient for analyzing Cu species with low content, the chemical and atomic structure of Cu sites in PR-CuNC were further investigated by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Fig. 1e illustrates Cu K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of PR-CuNC and several reference samples. In comparison to Cu2O and Cu foil, the adsorption edge for PR-CuNC is located at a higher energy close to CuO, indicating Cu atoms are in an oxidized state. The first derivative of PR-CuNC is between that of Cu2O and CuO (in the inset of Fig. 1e), which confirms that the valence state of Cu for PR-CuNC is between +1 and +2, consistent with the observation from the Cu 2p XPS of PR-CuNC [21], [28]. The Fourier-transformed X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectra were obtained to verify the accurate structure of Cu atoms in PR-CuNC displayed in Fig. 1f. Cu foil reveals a main peak at around 2.24 Å corresponding to the Cu-Cu bond. In contrast, PR-CuNC only shows a single peak centered at 1.45 Å assigned to the Cu–N bond, differing from the Cu-O bond in CuO and Cu2O [46]. It confirms that Cu atoms in PR-CuNC are separated from each other and coordinated with first-shell N atoms, which is in agreement with the result of the HAADF-STEM. Besides, the best fitting results of EXAFS k and R-space provide detailed structural parameters in Fig. S6 and Table S6. According to the coordination number of 4.54, the Cu atom was bonded by four N atoms with Cu-N bonds, implying the Cu-N4 configurations in PR-CuNC. On the contrary, the model of Cu coordinated with pyrrolic nitrogen shows worse fitting results in Fig. S7, indicating that Cu atoms in PR-CuNC were more coordinated with pyridinic-N, which is consistent with XPS results. Moreover, wavelet transfer (WT) plots in Fig. 1g–i were applied to better visualize the Cu-K edge EXAFS oscillations. Cu foil depicts an intensity maximum at around 8 Å−1 belonging to the Cu-Cu bond. In contrast, the only intensity maximum of PR-CuNC is observed at 4 Å−1 assigning to the Cu-N bond, which slightly differs in the Cu-O bond (about 6 Å−1) in Cu2O [47].\n",
    "3.2. Electrochemical performance for the NO3RR\n",
    "The electrochemical measurements for NO3- reduction reaction were conducted in H-cell using Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH with and without 0.1 M KNO3- as electrolytes. Fig. 2a shows the LSV curves for PR-CuNC, CuNC, and NC. After adding NO3-, the current densities for all samples improve dramatically, demonstrating the occurrences of the NO3RR. Compared with CuNC and NC, PR-CuNC reaches a relatively high current density of 90 mA cm−2 at –0.9 V vs. RHE and a low onset potential of + 0.1 V vs. RHE, indicating superior activity for nitrate reduction. Moreover, a small reduction peak at 0.0 V vs. RHE and another wide reduction peak at around –0.5 V vs. RHE belong to the NO3--to-NO2- reduction and NO2--to-NH3 process [21], [48]. Additionally, EIS tests were conducted on PR-CuNC and CuNC to measure the charge-transfer resistances during the electrochemical NO3RR process. As shown in Fig. S8, the Nyquist plots displays PR-CuNC with a smaller semicircle diameter and charge transfer resistance (23.21 Ω) than that of CuNC (42.29 Ω) at –0.2 V vs. RHE, suggesting a faster kinetics rate for the NO3RR.\n",

    "\n",
    "To further evaluate the NO3RR performance, current density–time (I–t) curves of all samples from –0.1 to –0.6 V vs. RHE were recorded (Fig. S9). Then, the amount of produced NH3 in electrolytes after I-t tests were determined by the indophenol blue spectrophotometric method for calculating Faraday efficiency (FE, Fig. S10). As shown in Fig. 2b, PR-CuNC outperforms all catalysts at almost all potentials, reaching a maximum FE of 94.61 %. In contrast, CuNC displays inferior activity with a maximum FE of 76.99 %, implying that rich Cu-pyridinic-N coordination configuration in PR-CuNC significantly enhances the NO3RR activity. Furthermore, Cu-NC catalysts with higher or lower pyridinic-N content (denoted as HP-Cu-NC and LP-Cu-NC) were obtained by introducing PEI with different concentrations (Fig. S11 and Table S7). Electrochemical nitrate reduction experiments in a 0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M KNO3 electrolyte showed that as the pyridinic-N content increased, the FE also increased, supporting our previous interpretation (Fig. S12). While NC has almost no catalytic capacity for NO3RR, the NH3 production is nearly negligible at less than 30 %, suggesting that Cu sites are the dominant active sites remarkably contributing to the nitrate-to-ammonia conversion. When the applied potential for PR-CuNC is below –0.5 V vs. RHE, the Faraday efficiency of NH3 decreases even though the total current density continues to increase, indicating that other side reactions weaken the ammonia production rate. The complex NO3RR process is associated with a variety of nitrogenous byproducts such as NO2-, N2, N2H4, and NOx, accompanied by fierce competition with the HER. It is therefore necessary to detect the FE of major products (NO2- and H2) for further evaluation of selectivity. As depicted in Fig. 2c, NO2- is the primary product at low overpotential for PR-CuNC. With applied a more negative potential, the FE of NO2- gradually decreased, which can be contributed to the NO2--to-NH3 reduction wide peak at near –0.5 V vs. RHE (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the competitive HER affects NH3 selectivity from –0.4 V, and the maximum Faraday efficiency reaches 6.92 % at –0.6 V on PR-CuNC. The same product analysis of CuNC and NC was conducted and shown in Fig. S13. As with PR-CuNC, the major byproduct of CuNC and NC changes from NO2- and H2 as the overpotential rises, while the FE values of H2 in two samples are much higher, reaching 22.38 % and 17.65 % at –0.6 V vs. RHE, respectively. Consequently, pyridinic-N-rich Cu sites in PR-CuNC can effectively suppress the HER and NO2- formation during high overpotential, which greatly facilitates the NH3 generation from NO3-. Meanwhile, the yield rates based on the geometric area of electrodes (YRA) (see details in supporting information) of different catalysts were detected at varying potentials (Fig. 2d). PR-CuNC demonstrates a much higher YRA of 3.74 mgNH3 h−1 cm−2 at –0.5 V vs. RHE than that of CuNC (1.10 mgNH3 h−1 cm−2) and NC (0.08 mgNH3 h−1 cm−2). To avoid the contribution from the Cu content, the YR was normalized by the mass of Cu labeled as YRCu in PR-CuNC and CuNC (see details in supporting information). As shown in Fig. 2e, PR-CuNC achieves 130.71 mgNH3 mgCu−1 h−1 at –0.5 V vs. RHE, which outperforms CuNC with the YRCu of 71.87 mgNH3 mgCu−1 h−1. Combining the XPS results, the enhanced FE and YR of PR-CuNC over CuNC could be ascribed to the increased pyridinic-N structure. Notably, the NO3RR performance of PR-CuNC at a relatively low overpotential is superior to most reported single-atom catalysts which be summarized in Table S8.\n",
    "The catalyst stability during the electrochemical process of NO3RR is a crucial factor in measuring the quality and applicability of catalysts. Therefore, ten consecutive electrolysis experiments were carried out at –0.5 V vs. RHE using the same electrode and further calculated the FE and YRCu to investigate the durability of PR-CuNC. After 10 cycles, FE is consistently higher than 85 % and YR remains stable above 120 mgNH3 mgCu−1 h−1 (Fig. 2f), demonstrating convincingly the excellent electrochemical recyclability of PR-CuNC. The initial improvement of catalytic performance might be attributed to the catalyst on the electrode surface being fully activated after electrolysis and then gradually reaching a steady state (Fig. S14). In addition to electrochemical stability, the structural stability of the PR-CuNC was also evaluated. As shown in Fig. S15, SEM images showed that the catalyst after tests still exhibited a porous granular structure, which was similar to PR-CuNC before tests. Besides, no aggregation of Cu atoms was observed in TEM images (Fig. S16 and S17), suggesting the morphology of the catalyst barely changed. According to XPS survey spectra (Fig. S18), the area of the double characteristic peaks assigned to Cu1+/Cu0 increased after NO3RR tests, while that of Cu2+ became smaller, implying the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu1+/Cu0 during the NO3RR.\n",
    "Additionally, the 15N isotope labeling proton nuclear magnetic resource (1H NMR) was performed to verify the precision of the NH3 measurements and eliminate the possible ammonia contamination from the environment. Electrochemical tests were conducted using 14NO3- and 15NO3- as nitrate sources, respectively. Fig. S19a exhibits different 1H NMR spectra of ammonia synthesized from different nitrate sources. 14NH4+ owns triple peaks with a spacing of 52 Hz, while 15NH4+ shows characteristic double peaks with a spacing of 72 Hz. Meanwhile, maleic acid was used as an internal standard for quantifying the generated ammonia. As shown in Fig. S19b, the yield of produced 15NH4+ (17.04 μmol) is very close to that of 14NH4+ (16.92 μmol), implying that the NH3 determined in this work only derived from the electrocatalytic nitrate process. Moreover, the amount of ammonia quantified by 1H NMR (16.92 μmol) is comparable to that detected by the UV-Vis method (16.96 μmol), confirming the reliability of the results from indophenol blue spectrophotometry.\n",
    "3.3. Theoretical understanding of the catalytic mechanism\n",
    "To further understand the mechanistic insights of the superior nitrate selectivity exhibited by the pyridinic-N-rich Cu SACs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to investigate the structure-activity relationship. XANES and EXAFS results indicate the center Cu atom is isolated and coordinated to the surrounding N. Herein, we constructed two Cu-N4 catalyst models, in which Cu single atoms are coordinated with four pyridinic-N (Cu-pyridinic-N4) and four pyrrolic-N (Cu-pyrrolic-N4), respectively. The charge density differences of the above two Cu-N4 models are illustrated in Fig. 3a–b, which depict obviously different charge distributions. Compared to Cu-pyrrolic-N4, Cu-pyridinic-N4 exhibits a change in electron depletion around the Cu atom and a stronger electron accumulation around C atoms bonded to N. Moreover, the partial densities of states (PDOS) of Cu-pyridinic-N4 and Cu-pyrrolic-N4 were presented in Fig. 3c. Cu d orbital of Cu-pyridinic-N4 has obvious energy level splitting near the Fermi level and the negative shift of the active center compared to that of Cu-pyrrolic-N4. Due to apparent hybridization between Cu d and N p orbitals as well as the higher overlap regions of electron density at the bonding orbitals, the Cu-pyridinic-N4 type is more favorable to electron transfer and is more active for adsorbed NO3-. The different distributions of state density demonstrate that the electronic structure of Cu-N4 is regulated by the types of coordination N.\n",

    "\n",
    "The catalytic details for NO3RR are obtained by the Gibbs free energy diagram. The element steps including nine elementary steps and eight intermediates as considered based on the previously reported mechanism [1], [12], [49]. Moreover, the geometry structures of all intermediates generated on the Cu-N4 were optimized before thermodynamic calculations (as the bottom of Fig. 3d). The first step in adsorbing NO3- to give *NO3 is considered crucial, as it matters whether the reaction can begin spontaneously. As shown in Fig. 3d, the adsorption energy of NO3- (ΔGNO3) substantially declines to –2.06 eV on Cu-pyridinic-N4, while the ΔGNO3 declines to –2.53 eV on Cu-pyrrolic-N4, indicating that Cu-pyridinic-N4 was more advantageous for NO3- adsorption. Then, as two N-O bonds on *NO3 break in sequence to form *NO2 and *NO, the energy gradually decreases. However, a large energy barrier needs to be overcome in the subsequent hydrogenation process, referring to the step from *NO to *NHO. Cu-pyridinic-N4 shows a lower ΔG*NHO of + 0.07 eV than Cu-pyrrolic-N4 (+0.51 eV), implying that Cu-pyridinic-N4 is more active for the protonation of *NO. Subsequently, two successive protonation steps of *NHO and cleavage of N-O bonds generate *NH2, followed by a hydrogenation process to obtain adsorbed *NH3. Finally, *NH3 undergoes a desorption step from the catalyst surface to produce the free NH3, completing the whole nitrate reduction reaction to ammonia. Overall, the NO3RR steps are exothermic except for the *NHO formation, which is considered a rate-limiting step. The larger ΔGNO3 and the lower energy barrier of the rate-limiting step indicate that the Cu-pyridinic-N4 structure is more favorable for ammonia synthesis from NO3-. The Gibbs free energy diagrams of HER on Cu-pyridinic-N4 and Cu-pyrrolic-N4 were analyzed in the top right of Fig. 3d. The higher ΔGH2O of Cu-pyridinic-N4 (0.39 eV) than that of Cu-pyrrolic-N4 (0.32 eV), suggesting a more favorable capability for capturing H2O molecules effectively. Furthermore, the decomposition of *H2O is considered a rate-determining step, where the larger energy barrier (ΔG=0.52 eV) observed on the Cu-pyridinic-N4 demonstrates the suppressed HER compared with the Cu-pyrrolic-N4 surface (ΔG=0.35 eV).\n",
    "4. Conclusion\n",
    "In summary, a hydrogel-derived pyridinic-N-rich Cu single-atom catalyst was synthesized in this work by successfully regulating the structure of coordination N atoms. The absolute content of pyridinic-N increases from 1.99 % to 3.20 % by forming semi-interpenetrating PPy-PEI hydrogels with abundant N sites. Efficient NO3--to-NH3 reduction was achieved on PR-CuNC at low overpotentials, reaching a maximal Faraday efficiency of 94.61 % and a yield rate of 130.71 mgNH3 mgCu−1 h−1. According to NO3- reduction experiments and DFT calculations, we disclose that the high NO3RR activity and selectivity for NH3 of PR-CuNC originated from the single-atom Cu sites coordinated with four pyridinic-N atoms. Importantly, the different charge density differences and PDOS of Cu-pyrrolic-N4 and Cu-pyridinic-N4 demonstrate the change in electron structure between Cu and N atoms. Compared to Cu-pyrrolic-N4, the Cu-pyridinic-N4 has a more advantageous NO3- adsorption ability and lower energy barrier for protonating *NO to *NHO during the NO3RR reaction steps. This study highlights a strategy to directly regulate the local nitrogen microenvironment of single-atom catalysts at the molecular scale. This work also provides a deeper understanding of the essential relationship between the coordination environment of the atomic site and catalytic behavior for various catalytic reactions.\n",

    "Ammonia (NH3), as a clean energy carrier, has been perceived as a promising candidate to replace gaseous hydrogen, given its high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities in a liquid state. (1−3) NH3 is important not only in the field of energy supply, but it also plays an important role in the development of fertilizers, medications, explosives, dyes, resins, and plastics. (4−6) One of the most prominent advantages of ammonia is that it can be compressed to a liquid at a pressure as low as 8 bar under room temperature. (6) Giving credit to the huge efforts of previous researchers, a mature system of liquid ammonia storage, transport, and infrastructure has been well developed. However, the traditional NH3 production of the Haber–Bosch process requires high energy input and high pressure, consumes lots of natural gas, and releases greenhouse gas into the environment. (7) Considering carbon neutrality is the future vision for humans, diminishing and even eliminating the carbon footprint is urgently required.\n",
    "The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) has been considered a promising alternative strategy to produce NH3, given its benign reaction conditions, renewable energy source, and environment-friendly reaction precursor (N2 and water). Major efforts have been devoted to investigating the various catalysts which could provide a high yield as well as high selectivity for NH3. (8−14) Among all types of catalysts, single atom catalysts (SACs) stand out from the crowd due to their distinctive merits, for instance, high atom utilization, exceptional catalytic performance, and well-defined active center. (15−22) Numerous SACs, such as N-doped carbon, (8,23) Ru, (24,25) Au, (26) Fe, (13,27) and rare earth metals (Y and Sc) (10) have been investigated for the ENRR to produce NH3. Besides varying the different dopants as the active center, the coordination environment (coordinated atom, number, vacancy) also plays an important role in the performance enhancement. (28−32) Meanwhile, the HER is the representative competitive reaction in the ENRR process. Designing the catalyst with an electron-deficient active center is also a feasible way to improve the performance. (33) However, simultaneously improving the Faradaic efficiency (FE) and yield is still challenging for the single-atom center because of the multiple reaction intermediates during the ENRR process. To deal with this issue, single-atom-dimer (SAD) catalysts with a dual single-atom active center emerge as a promising strategy. Theoretically, various homonuclear and heteronuclear SAD catalysts with metal dimers confined in 2-dimensional (2D) expanded phthalocyanine have been investigated for the NRR. (34) Strain-induced bi-Ti3+ pairs on anatase TiO2 as the active center for N2 fixation have been reported, and the ammonia yield rate was 8.90 μg h–1 cm–2 at −0.45 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). (16) Not only in the field of the NRR, but SAD catalysts have also been applied in CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RRs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) as the electrocatalysts and photocatalysts. (17−19,35,36) Nevertheless, the performances of the ENRRs based on previous research are still insufficient, and more investigations for modifying the electronic structure and the environment of SAD catalysts are still required. As for the choice of metal center for dimer catalysts, vanadium is selected based on the outstanding performance of its bulk materials. Vanadium carbide (VC) with periodic anionic vacancies was reported with the NH3 yield rate of 23.2 μg h–1 mg–1 and FE of 18.3%. (37) Vanadium nitride (VN) showed a yield rate of 1.1 × 10–10 mol s–1 cm–2 with a long stability of 116 h. (38) Vanadium phosphide (VP) performed with the yield rate of 8.35 × 10–11 mol s–1 cm–2 and the FE of 22%. (39) Vanadium–nickel oxynitride showed a yield rate of 6.78 μg h–1 cm–2. (40) Vanadium dimer supported on phthalocyanine (V2-Pc) was theoretically proved to effectively suppress the competitive HER. (34) Though the bulk materials of vanadium have been widely investigated for the NRR, the single atom or dimer structure deemed to have better performance has not been stepped into deeply.\n",
    "Herein, inspired by the above discussion, we present an oxygen-bridged vanadium dimer (V-O-V) catalyst on N-doped carbon (O-V2-NC) configuration for the ENRR. The oxygen bridge over the V dimer results in an electron-deficient active site of V for efficient N2 adsorption, and the V single-atom dimer could further modulate the multiple reaction intermediates during the ENRR process. By using the X-ray absorption fine structure technique (XAFS), in combination with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the existence of V-O-V was experimentally confirmed. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations found the structural evolution of O-V2-NC during the N2 protonation process, which involves the V-O-V structure splitting into V-O and V during the protonation and regenerating to the original V-O-V after the release of NH3 from the active center. Due to the efficient N2 adsorption and charge transfer induced by oxygen-bridged V-V atoms, O-V2-NC exhibits a considerable FE of 77% at 0 V (vs RHE) and a comparatively high NH3 yield of 26 μg h–1 mg–1 at −0.4 V (vs RHE). 15N isotope experiments and 1H NMR further proved that NH3 was indeed produced from the NRR.\n",
    "Results and Discussion\n",
    "Synthesis and Structural Characterizations\n",
    "O-V2-NC was synthesized by a simple template-assisted pyrolysis method, as shown in Figure 1. First, melamine cyanurate (MCA), as a template and nitrogen source, was prepared by mixing melamine and cyanuric acid. Then, vanadium ions were trapped by the amino of polyaniline and the reaction proceeded with calcination under high-temperature treatment. Lastly, acid etching was applied to remove nanoparticles to obtain a vanadium single-atom dimer. Details of the synthesis process are described in the Experimental Section. The as-synthesized O-V2-NC material without acid etching shows distinct vanadium oxide peaks, which are matched with PDF#64-9474, while after acid etching, only amorphous carbon peaks appeared, which is similar to the NC sample without any vanadium precursor (Figure 2a). Raman spectra are performed under the excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Two peaks at 1350 and 1580 cm–1 correspond to the D and G bands. The intensity ratios of the D band to G band (ID/IG) for O-V2-NC and NC are 1.042 and 1.078, respectively. A weak broad 2D peak around 2760 cm–1 indicates the poor crystallinity of the samples (Figure S1). The materials prepared by the above method appear as a carbon sheet structure. It is also worth noting that the surface of O-V2-NC is crumpled, and a porous structure is observed after acid treatment (Figure S2). The O-V2-NC clearly presents a porous structure of O-V2-NC. The pore size varies from 2 to 15 nm, and the average pore size is around 5.12 nm (Figure S3). Element mapping images present that vanadium atoms are distributed uniformly over the sample (Figure 2c). Combined with the results of XPS, ICP, and EDS, the average amount of vanadium, around 1.32 wt %, is calculated (Figure S4). Nitrogen adsorption and desorption performance are recorded to investigate the surface and porous properties of the samples. As shown in Figure 2b, the nitrogen take-up of O-V2-NC is much larger than that of NC. O-V2-NC and NC both exhibit an isotherm curve similar to type I. A steep uptake appeared at very low relative pressure, suggesting considerable adsorbent–adsorbate interactions (strong nitrogen adsorption in this case). The strong adsorption capacity is crucial to capture the reactant and make it easier to perform the hydrogenation reaction subsequently. (41,42) An H4 hysteresis loop is observed, which indicates that this catalyst possesses a micropore and plate-like structure. (43) Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) data are extracted from the adsorption part, and a sharp peak emerges at the pore diameter of 3.9 nm. Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) results further prove that O-V2-NC possesses a higher monolayer nitrogen adsorption. And the surface area of O-V2-NC is higher than that of NC by around 2.5 times (Table S1). This implies the significance of the preparation method for constructing the porosity and high surface area of nanosheets, which enables O-V2-NC to capture N2 more efficiently during the electroreduction process.\n",

    "To investigate the microenvironment of vanadium single-atom dimers, XPS and XAFS measurements are conducted. As shown in Figure S5, for N 1s of O-V2-NC, four peaks at 398.29, 399.4, 400.6, and 401.99 can be assigned to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, and oxidized N, respectively. (12) Comparably, these four peaks are found in the N 1s spectra of NC with a similar peak ratio distribution, which suggests that O-V2-NC and NC possess almost the same nitrogen species and nitrogen environment. The V–O bonds at 529.5 eV is assigned in the O 1s spectra of O-V2-NC (44) (Figure 3a), and two peaks at 522.94 and 515.75 eV are assigned to the V4+ 2p1/2 and V4+ 2p3/2 (45) (Figure 3b). As shown in Figure 3d–e, not only do the V–N/V–O bonds appear in the O-V2-NC sample but the clear V–V bond is also observed from the EXAFS results. Nevertheless, the V–V bond of O-V2-NC is longer than that of V foil. To further prove the existence of V-V dimers, Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM is conducted, the clear V distribution is obtained, and the V dimer is circled by a red rectangle (Figure 2d). Inevitably, single atoms also exist along with the dimer. Nevertheless, the amount of dimer still exceeds that of single atoms. The intensity profile in Figure 2e shows that the distance between V–V is around 2.70 Å, which is consistent with the EXAFS result. Given that there are no nanoparticles or nanoclusters observed in XRD and TEM, the V-V dimers are hypothesized to be in the O-V2-NC configuration. In addition, considering the V–O bond’s presence and the V–V bond’s length that is longer than the directly bonded V–V bond, the V-V dimers are proposed to be bridged by the O atom for the O-V2-NC structure (V-O-V). And the depicted structure is exhibited in Figure S6.\n",

    "To further prove the existence of the V-O-V structure experimentally, the O-V2-NC sample is treated under 250 °C for 2 h in a 5% H2 gas environment to remove the bridged O in V-O-V (the sample named V2-NC). As shown in Figure 3a, the samples without H2 treatment clearly show the existence of a V–O bond at 529.5 eV, even after the Ar etching of 30 s before XPS, while the V–O bond disappears after the H2 treatment, which indicates that the O is not captured from the atmosphere but uniformly distributed inside the whole structure. Consistently, the V 2p3/2 peak also shifted to lower binding energy from 515.75 to 515.2 eV after H2 treatment, which is attributed to the removal of O from V-O-V (Figure 3b). Figure 3c shows the XANES spectra of various vanadium species, The inset zooms in over the half-edge jump feature. The valence state of V is also correlated from the fitting of the V K-edge XANES energy at the half-edge jump. (46,47) As shown in Figure S7, the oxidation states of V2-NC and O-V2-NC are +4.2 and +4.33, which is consistent with the XPS data that V species mainly exist in the form of V4+. The XAFS analysis also reveals the shift of the bond length of V–V toward the shorter distance for V2-NC, further demonstrating the structural evolution from V-O-V to V-V (Figure 3d). The aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM shows the uniformly distributed V atoms after the H2 treatment, and the length between the V–V bond is around 2.49 Å (Figure 2f–g), which is also consistent with the XAFS result. Additionally, Figure S8 reveals that the C-O and C-N species still exist in the structure of V2-NC, and the ratio is consistent with that of O-V2-NC, which means that this H2 treatment is a comparatively mild condition and that it does not dramatically change the structure of the carbon substrate. To further prove the structural evolution from V-O-V to V-V, the EXAFS fitting is carried out to obtain the coordination information on V. Figure S9 shows the V K-edge FT-EXAFS of O-V2-NC and V2-NC with the corresponding EXAFS fitting curves. Table S2 summarizes the EXAFS fitting parameters at the V K-edge for O-V2-NC and V2-NC. From this result, the coordination number (CN) of V-N for O-V2-NC and V2-NC is around 3.4, suggesting that each V is coordinated by 3.4 N on average, which is consistent with the predicted structure (Figure S6). Compared with the O-V2-NC, the CN of V-O for V2-NC is reduced to 0.7 and the V–V bond distance for V2-NC decreased to 2.51 Å. That also indicates the structural evolution from V-O-V to V-V. Figure S10 exhibits the XPS spectra of O 1s and V 2p of the V2-NC post structure (the sample of V2-NC is treated at 0 V vs RHE for 30 min under the same NRR environment). The peaks at 522.5 and 515.9 eV are assigned to V4+ 2p1/2 and V4+ 2p3/2. The peaks at 521.2 and 514.1 eV are assigned to V2+ 2p1/2 and V2+ 2p3/2. The peak at 519.6 eV is assigned to the V satellite. The V–O bond at 529.8 eV appeared again, and the V 2p3/2 peak shifted to the high binding energy of 515.9 eV, which indicates that the O atom attached to the V after the experiment. That further experimentally proves that the V-O-V is the final stabilized structure during the NRR process.\n",
    "Electrochemical N2 Reduction\n",
    "The electrochemical NRR experiments were carried out in the H-type cell separated by a Nafion 115 membrane, with 30 mL of 0.1 M HCl as the electrolyte, on the electrochemical workstation (CHI 660C) under room temperature and ambient pressure. Prior to applying any potential, pure N2 was purged into 30 mL of electrolyte for 30 min. The linear sweep voltammetry was scanned at the rate of 5 mV·s–1. The N2 reduction reaction was conducted at 0 V, −0.1 V, −0.2 V, −0.3 V, −0.4 V, and −0.5 V for 1 h with continuous N2 feed-up. Unless otherwise noted, all the potentials were calibrated with the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Comprehensive electrochemical measurements were conducted to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the NRR. Figure 4a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve of O-V2-NC under Ar and N2 feed-up. The current density under N2 saturated conditions increases compared to that under Ar saturated conditions, which means the NRR occurred accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The indophenol blue method was applied to qualitatively and quantitatively measure the electrocatalytic produced NH3. As shown in Figure S11, a series of standard concentrations of ammonia solution was prepared, and the UV–vis absorbance was recorded. The concentration–absorbance curve of NH3 with a series of standard concentrations shows a good linear relation (y = 0.445x + 0.0429, R2 = 0.9997). Watt and Chrisp’s method was employed to exclude hydrazine production (Figure S12). As shown in Figure 4b, the NRR performance is conducted under different applied potentials from 0 V to −0.5 V (vs RHE). The NH3 yield rate shows growth with the increase of applied voltage and reaches the highest of 26.12 μg h–1 mg–1 at a voltage of −0.4 V vs RHE. The highest FE of 77.2% is observed at the voltage of 0 V, which indicates that most energy is used to form ammonia even though with low current density. However, the FE drops down at applied high voltage, which is ascribed to the enhanced HER with the raising of applied voltage, especially under acidic conditions. The chronoamperometry results and UV–vis absorbance of the electrolyte after electrochemical reduction catalyzing by O-V2-NC under different voltages are recorded, as shown in Figure S13. For comparison, the NRR performance of NC is also tested at 0 V, including the NH3 yield rate of 2.3 μg h–1 mg–1 and FE of 23%, which are much lower than those of O-V2-NC (Figure S14). Therefore, V-V dimer atoms play the crucial role of active center to convert N2 to NH3 during the electrocatalytic process, while a comparatively high FE is achieved by NC, which was attributed to the high content of pyridinic and pyrrolic N species. Previous research reported that the high content of pyridinic and pyrrolic N was important for promoting nitrogen reduction to ammonia in nitrogen-doped carbon. (48,8) Consequently, based on this special structure of the carbon matrix, the addition of porosity and V-V dimer atoms in O-V2-NC could more efficiently facilitate the NRR performance. Hydrazine, as a byproduct of nitrogen reduction, is also monitored during the electrocatalytic NRR process. As shown in Figure S15, there is undetectable hydrazine in the electrolyte after 1 h of constant potential reduction. Control experiments under the Ar gas and open circuit potential (OCP) conditions are conducted. No NH3 generation was observed from the control experiments (Figure S16). Different amounts of VCl3 were dissolved in 0.1 M HCl and the absorption spectra were obtained by the indophenol blue method to investigate the effect of the V ions on the colorimetric method. As shown in Figure S17, 10 ppm of the V ion sample, which is 2,000 times higher than 5 ppb (V leaching after 10 cycles under −0.4 V, detected by ICP), shows a tiny hump. But 0.1 and 0.5 ppm, which are 20 and 50 times higher than 5 ppb, respectively, did not show any absorption changes. Therefore, only under the high concentration of metal ions can it be possible to affect the absorbance of the colorimetric method.\n",

    "\n",
    "To confirm if the NH3 in the electrolyte is indeed from the nitrogen reduction, a 15N isotope labeling experiment was carried out. (24,49,50) 15N2 is continuously fed into the electrolyte for 1 h during the electroreduction process at a fixed voltage of −0.4 V. The product obtained from the 15N2 experiment is qualitatively analyzed by 1H NMR. As shown in Figure 4e, the 14NH4+ containing electrolyte shows they typical three peaks with 14JN–H of 52.1 Hz, and the 15NH4+ containing electrolyte shows the typical two peaks with 15JN–H of 72.8 Hz, while in the case of 15N2 as the feed gas, the NMR peak becomes broader, and a small peak at 6.94 ppm appears. That is attributed to the trace amount of 14N2 inside the electrolyte, which cannot be eliminated completely. Three different methods are conducted for quantitative analysis of NH3 yield and FE. To obtain the corresponding calibration curves for quantitative analysis, various concentrations of 14NH4+ and 15NH4+ are prepared, and the NMR tests are carried out (Figures S18 and S19). The NMR pattern is calibrated by a TMS peak shift of 0 ppm. Maleic acid is also used as the internal standard for accurate analysis, whose peak appears at 6.3 ppm (Figure S20). This O-V2-NC also shows excellent stability over 10 cycles under 0 V with negligible reduction of yield and FE (Figure 4c). Figure S21 exhibits the NH3 yield rate and FE of O-V2-NC under 0 V detected by a different method (product of 14N as feed gas is checked by indophenol blue and product of 15N as feed gas is checked by NMR), which shows the comparative results. To further investigate the dimer structure stability of O-V2-NC, the long-time performance test is conducted under −0.4 V for 10 cycles and the characterizations of the material structure are also carried out. Figure S22 exhibits the charge density and UV–vis absorption of electrolyte of O-V2-NC under −0.4 V for 10 cycles. Figure 4d shows the NH3 yield and FE of O-V2-NC under −0.4 V for 10 cycles. This catalyst can keep good stability even under the high applied potential. The NH3 yield rate and FE under −0.4 V are 26 μg h–1 mg–1 and 4.6%. Figure 4f presents the NH3 yield rate and FE of O-V2-NC under −0.4 V detected by a different method, further confirming the reliability of the employed indophenol blue method. The Aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM and XPS are carried out to investigate the structural change of the O-V2-NC after the stability test. The catalyst still shows the dimer structure along with the single atoms and the distance between the V-V dimer is 2.77 Å (Figure S23). The V–O bond is maintained after the stability test (Figure S24). These results also demonstrate the excellent stability of the dimer structure in O-V2-NC. Compared with other catalysts used in acidic conditions, O-V2-NC presents a higher FE at low applied potential and efficient NH3 yield at high potential (Table S3).\n",
    "V samples with different amounts are synthesized to study the amount-dependent performance. VNC-5 and VNC-20 are prepared by adjusting the V precursor amount (0.05 mmol for VNC-5 and 0.2 mmol for VNC-20). The synthesis process is the same as that of O-V2-NC. The XRD result indicates the successful preparation of the V single atom (Figure S25). The STEM image also shows the uniform distribution of the V atoms, which are separated far away from each other due to less amount of V (Figure S26). The V amounts for VNC-5 and VNC-20 detected by ICP-MS are 0.11 and 0.591 wt %. The ENRR performances for VNC-5 and VNC-20 are conducted under the same conditions as that of O-V2-NC. Figures S27 and S28 exhibit the charge density and UV–vis absorption of the electrolyte from VNC-5 and VNC-20 under various applied potentials. With the increase of V amount, the ENRR performance is also enhanced. Similar phenomena are also observed from the results of VNC-5 and VNC-20. That is, the FE decreased with the higher applied potential, which is attributed to the facilitated HER in the acidic conditions (Figures S29 and S30). To further investigate the advantages of dimer catalysts on the performance, V single-atom-based material (V coordinated by phthalocyanine, VPC) with a similar V amount as O-V2-NC is applied to the ENRR. From the ICP-MS, VPC contains 3.4 wt % of V, so 3.8 mg of VPC mixed with 6.2 mg of NC makes the sample contain around 1.3 wt % of V (VPC-NC). The ENRR experiment is carried out under the same conditions as those of O-V2-NC. Figure S31 shows the charge density and UV–vis absorption of the electrolyte from VPC-NC under various applied potentials. The highest NH3 yield (12.5 μg h–1 mg–1) of VPC-NC increased compared with those of VNC-5 and VNC-20, but it is still much lower than that of O-V2-NC (Figure S32). This result suggests that the designed dimer structure (V-O-V) is more favorable for the ENRR process and further improves the performance. However, to distinguish the effect on the performance between a single atom and dimer more precisely, the coordination environment should also be considered, which requires more input effort to design the catalyst in the future.\n",
    "Theoretical Calculations\n",
    "DFT calculation was further performed to provide a theoretical view of the possible NRR mechanism. First, the formation energies of V2N6O and V2N6 are compared to investigate the stability of the proposed configuration, as shown in Table S4. The formation energies calculated for V2N6O and V2N6 are around −3.37 and 1.67 eV, respectively, which indicates that the V2N6O structure is more thermodynamically stable than V2N6. Figure S33 shows the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of H-adsorption over O (O-*H) and V (V-*H), as well as N2 adsorption over V (V-*N2). The ΔG of O-*H is 0.442 eV, which is much more positive than the ΔG of V-*H of 0.200 eV, implying that H is preferentially adsorbed on the V sites. Meanwhile, the ΔG of adsorbing N2 over V (V-*N2) is also calculated. The similar free energy between V-*H (0.200 eV) and V-*N2 (0.202 eV) indicates that H and N2 would compete for adsorbing over V sites. This could be the reason for the decrease in nitrogen reduction performance at the high applied potential. The NRR selectivity is also estimated by calculating the free energy difference between the H* and N2H* (ΔG(H*) – ΔG(N2H*)). A positive ΔG(H*) – ΔG(N2H*) value (>0) suggests a great preference for hydrogenation of N2* and retains good selectivity. (34) In our case, the value of ΔG(H*) – ΔG(N2H*) is −0.5 at the limiting potential UL (−0.64 V). It indicates a comparatively low preference for the hydrogenation of N2*, which is consistent with our experiment result of the lower FE at a high applied potential. This is attributed to the trade-off between the adsorption of H* and N2H*, as catalysts with strong binding for N2H* also involve the strong potential for H* adsorption, leading to poor selectivity under the reaction conditions. (51) Figure S34 demonstrates the depicted structure of adsorbing H and N2 on O-V2-NC. The potential limiting step for both the distal and alternating pathways is the last step (*NH2 → * + NH3) with an energy barrier of 0.64 eV. Nevertheless, there is one more barrier that needs to be overcome in the distal process (*NNH2 → *N), which makes the alternating pathway more favorable (Figure 5). Interestingly, the structural change of O-V2-NC is noticed by DFT calculation during the protonation process (Figure S35). At the step of the first protonation, the oxygen connected with two vanadium atoms (V-O-V) would break down to V-O and V due to the hindrance of *NNH, leaving the vanadium connected *NNH alone (V-*NNH) instead of V-O-V*NNH. This transformed structure lasts until all the nitrogen species are released from the vanadium and regenerate to the original V-O-V form for the next circle.\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "In this work, we developed a NRR dimer catalyst (O-V2-NC) with a peculiar local configuration in which the V dimer sites are bridged by one O atom (V-O-V). At 0 V vs RHE, the O-V2-NC exhibits a FE as high as 77% for NH3 production with a yield of 9.97 μg h–1 mg–1 and a relatively efficient yield rate of 26 μg h–1 mg–1 with the FE of 4.6% achieved at −0.4 V vs RHE. The advantages of the O-V2-NC coordination environment favor the NRR while suppressing hydrogen coupling, which is experimentally and theoretically certified. Interestingly, a loop evolution of the structure is found during the N2 reduction process of the DFT calculation, well explaining the excellent phenomena of activity and selectivity. This work gives further insights into investigating the role of varying structures during the catalytic process. In addition, this research will aid in exploring the single-atom dimer catalysts for selectively converting N2 to NH3 under benign conditions as well as the CO2 reduction reaction and nitrate reduction reaction, which possess the multi-intermediate and competitive HER reaction in the process. Not limited to this catalyst, other similarly designed catalysts with the proper electro-deficiency and coordination environment can also be applied to investigate the effect on the catalytic performance.\n",

    "Introduction\n",
    "Rechargeable zinc–air batteries (ZABs), as a new generation of green energy conversion devices, have been extensively explored due to the abundance of the zinc anode and high theoretical energy density (1086 W h kg−1).1–8 However, their large-scale application is still restricted by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as well as the high-cost and scarce benchmark Pt/C catalysts.9,10 Alternatively, single-atom catalysts (SACs), prominently featuring M–Nx sites (where M refers to Fe, Co, Ni, etc.) on carbon substrates, have been validated to be the most promising contributors to the ORR owing to their maximized atom-utilization efficiency.11–14 Among these, Fe–N4–C catalysts exhibit the most exceptional ORR potential.15–18 Nevertheless, the symmetric D4h electron distribution in the Fe–N4 site endows oxygen intermediates with strong binding energy, resulting in unsatisfactory ORR catalytic activity.19–23 Therefore, the accurate manipulation of geometry and electronic structure of Fe–N–C catalysts to optimize the binding energy of key intermediates is significant but challenging.\n",
    "The adsorption strength of intermediates on Fe–N4 active sites is primarily determined by the d-band centers of Fe atoms, heavily depending on their coordination environments and 3d orbitals’ electronic configurations.19,24–28 To regulate the electronic distribution and d-band energy levels of the surrounding metal sites, tremendous efforts have so far been devoted to adjusting the electron-withdrawing/donating properties of carbon carriers in the second coordination shell (CS) or further outside. For instance, the introduction of heterogeneous heteroatoms (B, P, S, O, etc.) with different atomic radii and electronegativity can distinctly improve the charge distribution on the carbon matrix surface.16,29–32 In this view, Yin et al. noticed that long-distance P atoms could drive electron delocalization of edge Fe–N4 and enhance ORR activity in acidic media.33 However, such long-range electron modulation may be limited by the strength of absorbing/donor moieties and the spatial interaction distance, leading to a diminished effect of electron delocalization.34,35 Hence, efficient modulation of the first CS has been proposed and extensively studied.36–40 For instance, ligand atoms have been directly anchored to host atoms, aimed at modulating the microenvironment or the electronic spin state of metal active centers for tailored d-band centers and intrinsic activity of Fe–N–C catalysts.41–44 In this respect, Li et al. induced the electron rearrangement and spin state transition of Fe–N3S catalysts by incorporating S atom-coordination to accelerate the nitrogen reduction reaction.42 Nevertheless, most studies have focused on coordination modulation or heteroatom substitution in the Fe–N4 plane while there is only a handful of reports on the modulation of the coordination number and geometrical structure design of metal centers. Furthermore, the promotion mechanism of electrocatalysis by the synergistic coordination effect of the first and second shells is still not clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Herein, a nuanced strategy was developed to meticulously tailor the coordination milieu and spin state of Fe sites. An innovative Fe–N4SP configuration with a high coordination structure was specifically designed through a multi-shell coupling strategy by decorating with axial-bridged sulfur atoms in the first CS surrounded by phosphorus atoms in the second CS. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations predicted broken electron symmetry of Fe–N4 sites using a high-coordination Fe–N4SP model along with a depressed d-band center and elevated spin density, resulting in declined *OH adsorption energy. Guided by the theoretical model, a single atom catalyst with Fe–N4SP sites on the N, P, and S ternary co-doped hollow carbon nanocage (Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC) was experimentally and precisely synthesized. Detailed structural characterization confirmed the critical role of highly coordinated configurations in tailoring the d-band centers, spin polarizations, and electronic structures. Consequently, the obtained Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC catalyst exhibited superior ORR activity, improved reaction kinetics, and enhanced stability in both alkaline and acidic media. When used in ZABs, the Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC exhibited high power density and amazing extra-long durability, superior to most reported catalysts even noble metal catalysts, demonstrating the potential practical application value.\n",

    "Results and discussion\n",
    "Theoretical prediction of Fe–N4SP model\n",
    "In this study, the restricted ORR activity of conventional Fe–N–C catalysts was explored by setting up a standard four-coordination model (Fe–N4) as a foundation for DFT computations (Fig. S1 of the ESI†). Initially, the Gibbs free energy profiles were calculated for the ORR's basic steps on the standard Fe–N4 model at variable pH levels. The step bearing the most significant thermodynamic hurdle was deemed the rate-determining step (RDS) of the overall ORR pathway. In Fig. S1a and b (ESI†), the *OH desorption step on the standard Fe–N4 model's surface emerged as the RDS in the ORR, pointing to the suboptimal activity of the Fe–N4 sites stemming from the overly robust binding between the *OH intermediate and Fe sites. Nevertheless, the Sabatier principle suggested that the catalyst's adsorption for reaction intermediates should neither be too strong nor too weak. Over-adsorption can lead to a detrimental buildup of reaction intermediates on the catalyst's surface, thereby obstructing the reaction. The binding energy of the intermediate on the Fe site would be contingent upon its d-band center position. Consequently, fine-tuning the d-band center to weaken the adsorption of *OH could significantly improve ORR catalysis in Fe–N–C materials. Meanwhile, the d-band center of the same element would be closely related to the width of its d-orbitals. As illustrated in Fig. 1(a), the broadening of the d-band resulted in an elongated and narrowed shape (state α to state β) since the change in the bandwidth did not affect the total number of energy levels. Under constant electron filling number, the entire band shifted downward after narrowing, accompanied by a drop in the d-band center (state β to state γ). Harnessing this principle, we aim to augment the coordination atoms (without replacements) of the Fe sites in Fe–N–C single-atom catalysts. In this case, higher coordination numbers would induce more intense d-orbital interactions of the single Fe atom, thereby widening the d-band and lowering the d-band center, conducive to weakening the adsorption of *OH.\n",

(e) The optimized structure of ORR intermediates on the Fe–N4SP model and free energy diagrams of Fe–N4SP at different electrode potentials in an acidic electrolyte.\t\n",
    "Accordingly, the Fe–N4SP configuration was designed to increase the coordination number of Fe sites by introducing axially bridged S atoms in the first CS and P atoms in the second CS. As expected, the d-band center of Fe–N4SP shifted to −1.9124 eV, a value 0.9 eV lower than the d-band center of the standard Fe–N4 configuration (−0.9802 eV, Fig. 1(b)–(d)). Furthermore, the computed ORR free energy diagrams of the Fe–N4SP model are displayed in Fig. 1(e). At U = 0[thin space (1/6-em)]V (vs. RHE), every reaction step in the Fe–N4SP configuration moved downhill, suggesting spontaneous and thermodynamically exothermic ORR processes. Notably, the free energy displayed an identical trend under alkaline correction, suggesting no altered RDS of the ORR process by pH adjustment (Fig. S2, ESI†). The limiting potential of Fe–N4SP was identified as 0.92[thin space (1/6-em)]V (Fig. 1(e)), highlighting the enhanced ORR activity that can be credited to the adsorption energy refinement of *OH intermediates by the highly coordinated structures in both acidic and alkaline environments. Moreover, we also developed the Fe–N4S and the Fe–N4P models to illustrate the functionality of sole S or P on the Fe–N4 configuration. As shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), the individual doping of S or P also optimized the adsorption of *OH to a certain extent. However, the overpotentials for both models did not exceed 0.76 V, which is significantly less efficient for the ORR compared to the Fe–N4SP model (0.92 V). This finding underscored the synergistic effect between the axially bridged S atoms and the second CS-doped P atoms, where sulfur increased the coordination number at the Fe center, and phosphorus disrupted the square planar symmetry of the Fe–N4 configuration. In particular, sulfur positioned axially and phosphorus situated at a near-neighbor location together contributed to a charge redistribution of the Fe–N4 sites (Fig. S5, ESI†). Consequently, this distinctive high-coordination Fe–N4SP configuration not only promoted the downward shift of the d-band center but also diminished the electronegativity and increased the spin density of the Fe center (Fig. 1(b)), conducive to facilitating the desorption of *OH intermediates.\n",

    "Preparation and morphological characterization of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC\n",
    "Based on the theoretical predictions, we precisely synthesized N, P, and S ternary co-doped hollow carbon nanocages with the Fe–N4SP configuration (Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC), followed by performance testing and mechanistic validation. The preparation procedure of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Initially, ZIF-8/FePc@PZS was synthesized by adding iron phthalocyanine (FePc) into the typical zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-8) followed by coating with a uniform layer of phosphonitrile polymer (PZS) on its surface. This method allowed the encapsulation of FePc in the cavity of ZIF-8 without a change in the crystal structure (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†) and the thickness of the PZS shell layer is about 20 nm (Fig. 2(b)). Afterward, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC was fabricated by one-step pyrolysis and acid etching of ZIF-8/FePc@PZS, in which doped N served as the effective anchoring sites for the Fe atom, while abundant P and S elements in PZS were synchronously doped into the carbon shell. Additionally, the S element was also directly and axially bonded to the Fe atom to modulate the electronic structure of Fe–N4. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC in Fig. 2(c), (d) and Fig. S8 (ESI†) displayed a hollow carbon nanocage without any lattice striations, revealing Fe moieties present as single atoms or tiny clusters. Such a unique hollow structure would maximize the accessibility of the active sites to the electrolyte, as well as facilitate ion transport and mass transfer during electrocatalysis.45–47 Furthermore, only a broad carbon peak (at 24.4°) was observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, proving the complete etching of FeP caused by pyrolysis (Fig. S8b, ESI†). The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) also confirmed uniformly dispersed Fe species as individual atoms throughout the hollow carbon shell (Fig. 2(e)). Additionally, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping illustrated the presence of well-distributed C, N, P, S, and Fe elements throughout the entire carbon matrix (Fig. 2(f)). Among them, the elemental contents of Fe, P, and S were determined to be 1.33%, 3.90%, and 2.15%, respectively (Table S1, ESI†).\n",

    "Formation mechanism of the hollow structure\n",
    "To gain insights into the formation of hollow structures and the influence of heteroatom doping, a series of controlled experiments were conducted and the corresponding morphologies are summarized in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Note that details of the experiments can be found in the ESI.† Obviously, Fe–N4/NC and Fe–N4P/NPC without S-doping depicted a similar porous solid polyhedron, with Fe–N4P/NPC accompanied by slight surface collapse, while Fe–N4S/NS-HC displayed a hollow nanocage (Fig. S10, ESI†). Thus, the S element played a key role in the formation of hollow structures. Further validation was implemented by thermogravimetric (TG) and XRD analyses. In Fig. S11a (ESI†), ZIF-8/FePc@PZS depicted a preferential decomposition at about 250 °C, while ZIF-8/FePc started to break down at 500 °C. Besides, the XRD pattern exhibited ZIF-8/FePc with the retained intact lattice structure of ZIF-8, while ZIF-8/FePc@PZS showed significant decomposition at 400 °C (Fig. S11b and c, ESI†). As the temperature rose to 600 °C, ZIF-8/FePc@PZS completely transformed into an amorphous carbon structure, while ZIF-8/FePc still retained the characteristic peak of ZnO. Therefore, the PZS shell contributed to the decomposition of ZIF-8/FePc. Note that the TG curve of ZIF-8/FePc@PZM highly coincided with ZIF-8/FePc, while ZIF-8/FePc@MZS also decomposed at 250 °C but at a lower decomposition rate than that of ZIF-8/FePc@PZS (Fig. S11a, ESI†). Thus, S played a vital role in the formation of hollow structures, while P accelerated the reaction to some extent.\n",
    "Based on this information, a formation mechanism of the hollow structure was proposed and the details are shown in Fig. S11d (ESI†). During the pyrolysis process, ZIF-8/FePc underwent decomposition induced by S2− ions from the PZS shell, releasing Zn2+ ions. The difference in radii between Zn2+ and S2− resulted in a lower inward transport rate of S2− than the outward diffusion of Zn2+, invoking the Kirkendall effect.48 The internal ZIF-8/FePc gradually decomposed and ultimately formed a hollow structure as a function of the occurrence of the Kirkendall effect. Simultaneously, the FePc molecules trapped in the ZIF-8 cavity were reduced in situ to form atomically dispersed Fe–N4 sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coordination configurations and spin states of catalysts\n",
    "The chemical valences and local coordination environments of Fe sites were clarified by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The Fe K-edge absorption of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC was situated between those of FePc and Fe2O3, elucidating an average valence of isolated Fe atoms of +2 to +3, as shown in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES, Fig. 3(a)). The coordination configurations of the Fe site were investigated by k3-weighted Fourier transform of Fe K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS) spectroscopy in the R-space (Fig. 3(b)). Only the peak of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC can be observed near 1.5 Å, consistent with FePc and corresponding to the predominant Fe–N scattering. The absence of the peak position at 2.2 Å demonstrated mainly anchored Fe atoms by N atoms instead of the Fe–Fe bond. It is noteworthy that a Fe–S peak can be detected in Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC via the quantitative least-squares curve-fitting, with coordination numbers of Fe–N and Fe–S calculated as 4.0 and 1.1 (Fig. 3(c), Fig. S12–S14 and Table S2, ESI†), respectively. In order to pinpoint the exact coordination structures of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC, we considered all possible models for the position of coordination S atoms according to EXAFS fitting results, including four in-plane sites and the axial position. And the total energies of these models were calculated by the DFT (Fig. S15, ESI†), which indicates that the energy is the lowest and the structure is the most stable when sulfur is positioned axially. This convincingly demonstrated each Fe atom coordinated to four in-plane nitrogen atoms and one axially oriented sulfur atom, unambiguously fitting with the Fe–N4SP configuration, where the shortened Fe–S bond implied the effect of P atoms in the second CS (Table S2, ESI†). The unique axial S-coordination and adjacent P-coordination moved the central Fe slightly out of the Fe–N4 plane, thereby breaking the symmetry interactions of the original Fe–N4 sites.49,50 Compared to Fe–N4/NC, a negative shift of 0.3 eV accompanied by a decrease in the L3/L2 ratio of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC were seen in Fe L2,3-edge XANES (Fig. 3(d)). Both indicated the declined valence state of the Fe center, consistent with DFT calculations (Fig. 1(b)). This revealed the strong electron transfer between Fe atoms and axial S atoms, as well as surrounding doped P atoms through d–p orbital hybridization. Additionally, the wavelet transform (WT) analysis shown in Fig. 3(e) illustrated only a maximum intensity at about 5 Å−1, corresponding to the Fe–N bond. The deviation in the contour toward ∼9 Å−1 can be attributed to the Fe–S contribution. Overall, the Fe–N4SP configuration was identified as the most probable structure of the Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC catalyst. Specifically, the Fe species were stabilized by the four N atoms as isolated atoms, while being modified by the S atom in the first CS combined with the P atom in the second CS.\n",

    "Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements were carried out to highlight the importance of 3d orbital electron arrangement in ORR activity. Note that in this technique, the g factor would directly be related to the paramagnetic absorption signal of the unpaired spin electron.51 As shown in Fig. 3(f), Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC exhibited the highest g value compared to Fe–N4P/NPC and Fe–N4/NC, indicating increased unpaired 3d electron numbers of the Fe center through doping of heteroatoms, especially axial S atoms. The higher saturation magnetization also meant more unpaired electrons in Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC (Fig. 3(g)). The zero-field cooling (ZFC) temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility tests were then performed to further explore the d-electrons spin states of Fe sites. The effective magnetic moments of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC and Fe–N4/NC calculated by fitting the curve of χ−1–T according to the Curie–Weiss law were 3.02 μeff and 1.73 μeff (Fig. 3(h)). Obviously, the highly coordinated configuration triggered by axial S atoms and proximal P atoms intensified the spin polarization in the 3d orbitals of Fe atoms, validating the DFT calculations (Fig. 1(b)). Thus, high-energy eg orbitals with more electron filling can be obtained in Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC for facilitated penetration of oxygen antibonding π-orbitals, thereby promoting O2 activation and reduction.52–55\n",

    "Modulation of the Fe content and porosity\n",
    "The influence of Fe sites was studied by preparing Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC with different Fe contents. As depicted in Fig. S16 (ESI†), all as-prepared Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC with different Fe contents exhibited similar hollow nanocage structures, further proving the unaffected structure of the catalysts by adding FePc. As the amount of added FePc increased, the metal phase gradually transformed from the FeP phase to the Fe2P phase, and all metal phosphides were removed after acid leaching (Fig. S17, ESI†). The Fe contents of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC-0.5, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC-1.5, and Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC-2 determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) were 0.63, 1.33, 0.39, and 0.21 wt.% (Table S3, ESI†), respectively. Notably, the addition of excess FePc led to a decline in Fe content in the catalyst due to the weakened spatial confinement effect of ZIF-8, insufficient in limiting the migration of excessive FePc during pyrolysis and consequently triggering agglomeration. Most Fe moieties were removed as phosphate iron during subsequent acid etching, resulting in a lower Fe content in the catalysts. Interestingly, FePc was involved in modulating not only the densities of metal sites but also the specific surface area and porosity of the catalysts. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements shown in Fig. S18 and Table S4 (ESI†) revealed an increment in the specific surface area as a function of the amount of added FePc. Moreover, pore diameters of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC-0.5 and Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC were predominantly distributed between 2 and 4 nm, while larger mesopores (7–10 nm) started to form after the addition of 150 mg FePc, further confirming the aggregation of excess FePc. A large number of aggregated metal compounds were etched, leaving abundant hierarchical micro/mesopores in the carbon matrix. The large specific surface area and abundant pores could enhance the contact between the active site and electrolyte, as well as accelerate electron and mass transport.56,57\n",
    "Electrocatalytic ORR performance of catalysts\n",
    "The unique coordination configuration and electronic environment of the as-prepared catalysts prompted the investigation of their ORR properties in alkaline and acidic electrolytes in a three-electrode system. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of as-prepared catalysts evaluated in 0.1 M KOH are displayed in Fig. 4(a). The Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC presented a more positive half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.912 V than Fe–N4P/NPC (0.858 V), Fe–N4/NC (0.828 V), Pt/C (0.889 V), and most published state-of-the-art Fe-based electrocatalysts (Table S5, ESI†), indicating the excellent ORR activity of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC in alkaline media. Since a smaller Tafel slope would mean faster reaction kinetics, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC with a much smaller Tafel slope of 39.18 mV dec−1 than others would indicate the highly coordinated configuration contributing to an accelerated ORR process (Fig. 4(b)). Undeniably, the kinetic current density (Jk) is also a key parameter to evaluate the ORR activity. Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC showed a record Jk value of 60 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V, exceeding those of Fe–N4P/NPC, Fe–N4/NC, and Pt/C by 8.5-, 20-, and 4-fold, respectively (Fig. 4(c)). Furthermore, the effect of the hollow structure was explored by preparing Fe–N4/NPSC with a solid structure. As expected, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC exhibited better ORR performances, indicating the superiority of the hollow structure (Fig. S19, ESI†).\n",

    "The in-depth ORR details of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC are demonstrated in Fig. S20 (ESI†). Compared to the N2-saturated electrolyte, the pronounced reduction peak of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at 0.895 V illustrated good intrinsic reactivity in the O2-saturated electrolyte. The first-order reaction kinetics and a 4-electron transfer pathway were extrapolated by the parallel linear relationships in Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots. Furthermore, rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) tests confirmed a transfer electron number of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC close to 4 accompanied by a lower H2O2 yield (below 6%) than other catalysts, indicating its higher selectivity toward the 4-electron mediated ORR process (Fig. 4(d)). Afterward, the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was used to estimate the electrochemical surface areas (ECSA). As shown in Fig. 4(e) and Fig. S21 (ESI†), the Cdl value of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC was identified as 19.8 mF cm−2, superior to those of Fe–N4P/NPC (14.02 mF cm−2), Fe–N4/NC (9.87 mF cm−2), and Pt/C (15.25 mF cm−2). This result implied that the hollow structure endowed Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC with maximum exposure of active sites, thereby facilitating the ORR reaction. Besides, the catalyst stability was assessed by the LSV after cycling and chronoamperometric response (i–t) curves. As presented in Fig. 4(f), only 17 mV of decay in E1/2 was recorded after 10k cycles for Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC. Moreover, the current of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC still remained above 95% after continuously operating for 70 h, while Pt/C decayed to 68% only after 37 h (Fig. S20d, ESI†). All of the above results demonstrated the excellent ORR activity, reaction kinetics, and stability of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC in the alkaline media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broadened usefulness of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC was further investigated by evaluating the ORR performance in acidic media. As shown in Fig. 4(g)–(i), Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC also exhibited a striking ORR activity in 0.1 M HClO4 with an E1/2 value of 0.814 V and a Jk value of 46.7 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V, values much higher than those of Fe–N4P/NPC (E1/2 = 0.782 V, Jk = 15.7 mA cm−2) and Fe–N4/NC (E1/2 = 0.769 V, Jk = 14.3 mA cm−2), even exceeding those of commercial Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.785 V, Jk = 16.5 mA cm−2). Compared to other catalysts, the smallest Tafel slope (49.72 mV dec−1) and the largest Cdl (36.72 mF cm−2) of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC also implied faster reaction kinetics and a larger electrochemically active area (Fig. S22a, b and S23, ESI†). Meanwhile, RRDE experiments confirmed a high-efficiency 4e− ORR pathway with a transfer of 3.96 electrons per process accompanied by an H2O2 yield below 3% (Fig. 4(h)). Compared to Pt/C exhibiting 69% current retention attenuation after 52 h, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC showed a high current retention of 97% after 76 h and only 12.2 mV attenuation after 10k cycles, indicating outstanding long-cycle durability in an acidic electrolyte (Fig. S22c and d, ESI†). In addition, unlike the Pt/C, the CV curves and the current density of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC remained essentially unchanged after methanol crossover, inferring a favorable methanol tolerance in both acidic and alkaline environments (Fig. S24, ESI†). Significantly, the performances of the proposed Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC catalyst also compared well with previously reported single-atom catalysts (Table S6, ESI†). All these results corroborated the predominance of the designed theoretical model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effects of the metal site density on the catalytic ORR performance of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC with different Fe contents were also studied. Both the half-wave potential, the Tafel slope, and kinetic current density were positively correlated with the Fe content and far exceeded those of HPS-HC without Fe species (Fig. S25, ESI†), confirming the critical role played by isolated Fe–N4 sites in the ORR activity. Therefore, modulating the electronic structure and spin state of the Fe–N4 sites is essential to enhance ORR activity. Besides, the impacts of the calcination atmosphere on ORR activity were also compared in Fig. S26a and b (ESI†). Unlike results under an Ar atmosphere, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC obtained in Ar/NH3 exhibited a better E1/2 value and a smaller Tafel slope. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded to reveal the differences in chemical composition between Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC obtained under an Ar/NH3 and an Ar atmosphere. The high-resolution N 1s spectra of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC and Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC-Ar both displayed three peaks at 401.3, 400.4, and 398.5 eV, corresponding to graphitic-N, pyrrolic-N, and pyridinic-N, respectively (Fig. S26c, ESI†). Meaningfully, the results showed that a small amount of ammonia contributed to the enhancement of the N content in the catalyst, especially the percentage of pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N (Fig. S26d, ESI†), which were also considered important ORR active sites in previous reports.58–60 Overall, the single Fe atoms coordinated with pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N served as predominant catalytic active sites. Also, the enhanced ORR activity can be attributed to the near/long-range electronic regulation of the axial S-coordination and adjacent P-coordination, synergizing the unique hollow structure.\n",

    "Performance in zinc–air battery applications\n",
    "Inspired by the excellent ORR performance, a Zn–air battery (ZAB) was prepared with Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC as the catalyst and tested to verify its practical application value. The schematic illustration is shown in Fig. 5(a) and further details can be found in the ESI.† As expected, the ZAB based on Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC showed an open circuit voltage of 1.42 V and a specific capacity of 893 mA h gZn−1 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2, outperforming ZAB based on Pt/C (1.39 V and 752 mA h gZn−1, Fig. S27, ESI†). Moreover, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC-based ZAB possessed a better current density than others at the same voltage (Fig. 5(b)), and the peak power densities (225 mW cm−2) were 1.2-, 1.5-, and 1.3-fold higher than those of Fe–N4P/NPC, Fe–N4/NC, and Pt/C, respectively. These data were also superior to recently reported ZABs (Fig. S28 and Table S7, ESI†). The galvanostatic discharge curves of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC and Pt/C at different current densities revealed a decline in discharge potential plateau as the current density increased (Fig. 5(c)). However, the voltage of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC was permanently higher than that of Pt/C. Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC still maintained a voltage plateau of 1.12 V even at a high current density of 100 mA cm−2. As the current density gradually decreased, the voltage plateau also returned to the initial state, indicating the remarkable rate performance of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC. Significantly, unlike the obvious voltage drop of Pt/C-based ZAB at 130 h, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC-based ZAB still maintained an ultra-stable voltage window after continuous operation for over 320 h (approximately 2880 cycles), revealing superb long-term durability (Fig. 5(d) and Fig. S29, ESI†). It is worth mentioning that the charging voltage of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC-based ZAB is significantly lower than that of Pt/C-based ZAB, which can be attributed to the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC (Fig. S30, ESI†). Besides, as shown in Fig. 5(e), the charge/discharge voltage gap was only 0.704 V in the initial 10 cycles and the round-trip efficiency reached as high as 62.9%. Note that the voltage gap only increased by 2% and 9% at the 1505th and 2875th cycles, respectively. Also, the cycling efficiency still remained above 60% even after the 2875th cycle (Fig. 5(f) and (g)). In sum, the extra-long stability would greatly be important for the practical use of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC-based ZAB.\n",

    "Conclusions\n",
    "In summary, a meticulous multi-shell synergistic coordination strategy was successfully used to construct Fe–N4SP configurations with an elevated coordination number. DFT calculations and detailed structural characterization demonstrated that the precisely tailored interaction of axial S-coordination and adjacent P-coordination effectively induced electronic delocalization and decreased the d-band center of the Fe–N4 site, accompanied by an increase in the spin state. This strategy contributed to the activation and reduction of oxygen, as well as the desorption of *OH intermediates in the RDS, endowing Fe–N4SP with an enhanced ORR intrinsic activity. The optimal Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC catalyst displayed an impressive high half-wave potential (E1/2, 0.912 V in alkaline media and 0.814 V in acidic media) coupled with excellent kinetic current density (Jk, 60 mA cm−2 at 0.85 V in alkaline media and 46 mA cm−2 at 0.7 V in acidic media), along with an outstanding maximum power density of 225 mW cm−2 and continuous stable operation up to 320 h when used as the ZAB catalyst. This work unveils the critical role of the coordination micro milieu and spin state on the ORR catalytic performance, promising to guide the design and optimization of high-efficiency single-atom catalysts from the electronic level.\n",

    "# The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is considered as the key limiting reaction in various electrochemical devices such as water splitting1–6 and rechargeable metal–air batteries,7–10 has received significant research attention. The OER is a kinetically sluggish reaction, involving the transfer of four proton-coupled electrons towards the formation of an O[double bond, length as m-dash]O bond.11 Intensive efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the OER in an alkaline medium, wherein the interaction between the intermediate species and the local structure of the active sites have been investigated.12–14 According to the adsorption evolution mechanism, the OER activity is dominated by the adsorption energetics of the oxo-intermediates, whereby the optimization of adsorption is limited by the scaling relation.15 Specifically, the scaling relation of the OER is associated with the binding energies of the main intermediate species, namely OH* and OOH*, to the active sites.16 Thus, decoupling the scaling relation of the intermediate species through the surface structure design on the catalyst is considered to be the best strategy for the OER.17–19\n",
    "# However, the development of OER catalysts remains a challenge due to the high overpotentials required to drive the multi-electron and multi-proton redox reaction, which also accelerate the destruction of the highly active surface structures. It has been reported that the surface coverage of the intermediate species strongly affects the reaction kinetics at a low overpotential.20 Only at elevated potentials will the reaction intermediates gradually desorb from the metal sites by forming an oxygen molecule. Recently, numerous non-precious metal catalysts have been reported for OER electrocatalysis in alkaline conditions, mainly including Co-based, Ni-based, and Fe-based materials.21,22 Among them, Co–Fe dual-metal catalysts are found to possess high OER activity in alkaline conditions. Generally, the complicated OER catalytic process is associated with the participation of surface metallic active sites.23–28 Thus, identifying the synergistic effect between Fe and Co is critical for the comprehensive understanding of the reaction mechanism to design new bimetal-based catalysts with high efficiency. Hu et al. revealed the formation of the Co–Fe active site structure during electrochemical activation through operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, confirming the presence of Co–Fe dual-atom sites.29 However, the synergetic mechanism of the dual-active sites in the electrocatalytic process is far from being clearly understood due to the complex catalytic interface and limited monitoring methods. Most studies on Co/Fe dual-atom catalysts are devoted to identifying the active sites and the underlying catalytic mechanism.30–33 However, the real catalytic mechanism, which is associated with the evolution of the Co/Fe dual-metal sites during the catalytic process, is ambiguous, and thus should be seriously considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Herein, a Co/Fe dual-metal-site catalyst was prepared using the reverse-micelle assembly-pyrolysis strategy, which exhibited a superior performance towards the OER. The overpotential of the optimized catalyst at 10 mA cm−2 was determined to be as low as 240 mV, which is lower than that of the benchmark commercial IrO2 catalyst. Experimental evidence suggests that the synergistic effect between Co and Fe activates the generation of OOH*, whereby the Co and Fe sites act as the active site and catalytic promoter, respectively. The FesiteOOH sites originate from the oxidation of Fe2+ in alkaline media at a high potential, which can further trigger the formation of CositeOOH active sites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the synergistic effect between the Fe and Co single-atom-sites on the improved OER kinetics. The pinned Co-3d orbitals showed high electron transfer efficiency, while the Fe-3d orbitals protected the Co sites to sustain high electrocatalytic activity during the OER. The insight into the synergistic effect of the Fe and Co sites in Co/Fe-SNC gained from this study will shed light on the design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.\n",

    "# Results and discussion\n",
    "# The preparation of the Co/Fe-SNC catalyst is illustrated in Scheme 1. Firstly, the well-dispersed Fe(OH)x/Co(OH)x@SNC precursor was obtained via a microemulsion-co-precipitation reaction, with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), melamine (M), trithiocyanuric acid (TCA) and metal salt (CoCl2 and FeCl2·4H2O) in the presence of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) followed by the addition of polyetherimide (PEI), which was stirred overnight. Then, the as-prepared Fe(OH)x/Co(OH)x@SNC precursor powder was pyrolyzed at 800 °C to stabilize the metal-N/S coordination structure, whereby the Fe and Co atoms were coordinated to the N or S species hosted in the carbon substrates, resulting in atomically dispersed Co/Fe dual-sites. Finally, acid leaching was carried out to remove the metal or metal oxide nanoparticles, which could ensure the exposure of the atomically dispersed metal sites, avoid the blockage of the porous structure and improve the electrical conductivity of the materials.\n",

    "# Scheme 1 Schematic illustration of the preparation of Co/Fe-SNC800.\t\n",
    "# The morphology, microstructure, and composition of the catalysts were systematically characterized by electron microscopy. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1a and b, respectively) reveal that the Co/Fe-SNC800 catalyst shows a typical open hollow sphere with a hierarchical porous structure consisting of micropores and mesopores, which was also confirmed by the Brunner–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements (the inset in Fig. 1b and Fig. S1, ESI†). The pore size curves indicate that all the catalysts possess a dominant micro-meso-pore distribution with a pore size ranging from 5 to 50 nm. Co/Fe-SNC800 shows higher microporous structures (Fig. S1b, ESI†), leading to its higher surface area (242.6 m2 g−1) than that of its single-metal counterparts, i.e., Fe-SNC800 (126.9 m2 g−1) and Co-SNC (67.3 m2 g−1). Moreover, abundant cross-linking channels can be observed, which are separated by the ultrathin nano-walls with a thickness in the range of 2.5∼4.5 nm, as shown in Fig. 1c. The fluffy porous structures result in a high degree of defects, which was verified by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The low ID/IG value (0.918) of Co/Fe-SNC800 may result from the reconstruction of defect structures induced by favorable anchoring of the Co/Fe bimetal sites at the edge/corner-rich structures. Furthermore, peaks associated with the vibrational modes of FeOx or CoOx cannot be observed at the low wavenumber region, suggesting the absence of metal oxides in the catalysts34 (Fig. S2b, ESI†), which is consistent with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results (Fig. S3, ESI†). The XRD pattern of the catalysts displays a broad peak centered at 24.5° and a weak peak at 43.5°, which can be indexed to the (002) and (100) crystallographic planes of carbon, respectively, while no crystalline inorganic phases can be detected. The metal contents of the catalyst were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), Co/Fe-SNC800 contains 1.18 wt% Fe and 1.66 wt% Co metals, suggesting that the total metal content is higher than that of Fe-SNC800 (1.09 wt% Fe) and Co-SNC800 (1.24 wt% Co), respectively. The energy-dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) mapping indicates that the C, N, S, O, Co, and Fe atoms are uniformly distributed on the carbon matrix (Fig. 1d). Besides, the high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image confirms the presence of the dual-metal sites, as shown in Fig. 1e and Fig. S4 (ESI†), which are displayed as two adjacent bright dots circled with pink marks. The representative dual-atom site in Region 1 in Fig. 1f is evidenced in the raster graphic. The intensity profile of the dual-atom sites in Region 1 reveals the presence of a diatomic feature, with a bond length of 3.479 Å (Fig. 1g). It is inevitable that the dual-atom-site can co-exist with other metallic species on the surface, including single-atom-sites, triple-atom-sites, and clusters. To assess the possibility of the occurrence of dual-atom metallic sites, statistical analysis was carried out by counting 35 randomly picked metallic species in Fig. 1e and Fig. S4 (ESI†), with the percentage of each species displayed in the histogram, as shown in Fig. 1h. It should be noted that when discriminating the single-atom-site from the associated metallic atoms in the dual-atom or triple-atom, the atoms more than 9 Å apart were treated as isolated sites, whereas most of the dual-site atoms show distances in the range of 3–6 Å, consistent with the standard used in the literature.35 It can be seen that the percentage of dual-atom metallic sites is approximately 60.00% as the dominant metallic sites in Co/Fe-SNC800. Furthermore, the statistics histogram of the measured distances between the adjacent metal atoms in the dual-atom sites shows a dominant distance of 3–6 Å (Fig. 1i).\n",

    "# As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FTIR) display vibration bands located at low wavenumbers (<1000 cm−1), which are ascribed to the metal–nitrogen bond.36 The bands at around 900–650 cm−1 can be assigned to the Co–N or Fe–N vibrations. Both bands confirm the coordination between Co/Fe and N in the catalysts. As shown in the high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) core-level N 1s spectra (Fig. S6a, ESI†), the negative shifts in the pyridinic N and metal–N of Co/Fe-SNC800 compared with that of Fe-SNC800 and Co-SNC800 can be attributed to the coordination between the dual-atom metal (Fe, Co) and the adjacent N atoms.37,38 Besides, the highest metal–N component in Co/Fe-SNC800 suggests the highest content metal–N active sites due to the coexistence of Fe and Co (Fig. S6b, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), –C–S–C– is the potential dominant coordination for S in the catalysts, and the slight shift in the peaks associated with S 2p3/2 S2p1/2 in Co/Fe-SNC800 suggests the bonding between the metal atoms and S atoms.39,40 As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the Fe 2p peak of Co/Fe-SNC800 shifted to a low binding energy, while the Co 2p peaks shifted to a high binding energy compared to that of Fe-SNC800 and Co-SNC800, respectively, which is ascribed to the electron-coupling effect between the adjacent Fe and Co atoms.\n",

Similar trends were also observed in the Co k-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 2b), possibly because the square planar geometry of Fe and Co, like in FePc or CoPc, is distorted by the S doping. The k-edge absorption energy of Fe in Co/Fe-SNC800 is located between that of Fe2O3 and FePc, while the Co k-edge absorption energy is between that of Co2O3 and CoPc, suggesting that the oxidation state valances of both Fe and Co in Co/Fe-SNC800 are between +3 and +4. The plots of valence vs. energy are shown in Fig. S9 and 10 (ESI†), verifying that the valences of Fe and Co in Co/Fe-SNC800 are approximately +3.7 and +3.5, respectively. The Fourier-transformed (FT) k2-weighted EXAFS spectra of Fe for Co/Fe-SNC800 (Fig. 2c) shows the main peak at 1.63 Å, corresponding to the Fe–N/S bond, which is slightly larger than the bonding length of Fe–N in FePc (1.53 Å) due to the structural distortion. Fig. 2d suggests that Co–N/S are the nearest neighbouring atoms (1.47 Å), which is still slightly different from the Co–N bond length in CoPc, indicating the distorted Co–N coordination. In Co/Fe-SNC800, no metal-metal bonds (e.g., Co–Co, Fe–Fe, and Co–Fe coordination) can be observed, indicating that the isolated Fe and Co atoms are atomically dispersed without obvious aggregation. The wavelet transform (WT) further unambiguously reveals the isolated metal site in all the obtained catalysts (Fig. S11, ESI†).\n",

    "# As shown in Fig. 2e, the two k-edge features of C located at ∼286.3 and 288.7 eV can be assigned to the C–N bonds and Fe–C/Co–C bonds, respectively.41–43 Compared to Fe-SNC800, the metal–C bonds in Co/Fe-SNC800 almost disappeared, indicating the absence of the Fe–C or Co–C coordination in Co/Fe-SNC800. As shown in Fig. 2f, the k-edge XANES spectra of N show three peaks in the lower energy region, corresponding to the pyrrolic N (∼399.10 eV), Fe–N or Co–N coordination (∼400.2 eV) and graphitic N (∼401.8 eV), respectively.41,44 The metal–N (Fe–N and Co–N) coordination component of Co/Fe-SNC800 is 2-fold higher than that of Fe-SNC800 or Co-SNC800, owing to the Co–Fe dual-metal coordination with the adjacent N atoms. Two sharp peaks at 2472.5 and 2482.83 eV and a broad peak at 2497.9 eV were observed in the k-edge XANES spectra of S, which can be assigned to the transition of S 1s to the S-C state, S5+ and S6+, respectively (Fig. S12, ESI†).45–47 Particularly, the absence of a pre-edge peak related to the Fe–S bonds in the energy region of ∼2469–2471 eV indicates that there is no direct bonding between the Fe and S atoms in the catalysts.48,49 As shown in Fig. 2g and h, the R-space fitting results of Fe and Co k-edge reveal that the Fe and Co atoms in Co/Fe-SNC800 are atomically dispersed, whereby the configuration of the dual-metal site is dominated by FeN3-CoN2S coordination (Fig. 2i), respectively.\n",

    "# The OER activity of the catalysts was evaluated in O2-saturated 1.0 M KOH at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 3a, Co/Fe-SNC800 exhibited an onset potential (Eonset) of 1.42 V (vs. RHE, for all potential values) at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2. Moreover, the overpotential of Co/Fe-SNC800 for the OER at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was found to be as low as 240 mV, which is superior to that of Fe-SNC800 and Co-SNC800, even lower than that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst. The electrocatalytic activity Co/Fe-SNC800 substantially surpassed that of most of the recently reported dual-atom catalysts (Table S3, ESI†). The OER performances of the Co/Fe dual-metal-site catalysts were tuned by varying the Co/Fe precursor ratio. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), it can be found that too high or too low ratios of Co/Fe precursor had a negative impact on the OER activities. The highest mass activity (MA) value of Co/Fe-SNC800 with the optimized Co/Fe ratio (1/1) was determined to be 3.51 mA cm−2 g−1 (Fig. 3b). The effect of S-doping was evaluated by comparing the OER activity of Co/Fe-NC800 and Co/Fe-SNC800. As shown in Fig. S14a (ESI†), Co/Fe-NC800 showed lower OER activity than that of Co/Fe-SNC800, which is attributed to the inappropriate electronic structure of the active site in the absence of S atom. Additionally, the unfavorable morphology (Fig. S14b, ESI†) is also responsible for the low OER activity of Co/Fe-NC800. Tafel analysis was performed to assess the catalytic kinetics of the rate-determining step. The Tafel slope values are in the range of 40–60 mV dec−1, indicating high surface reactivity.50Fig. 3c shows that the calculated Tafel slope of Co/Fe-SNC800 (47.92 mV dec−1) is close to that of the commercial IrO2 (41.58 mV dec−1), but lower than that of Fe-SNC800 and Co-SNC800, implying its fast OER kinetics. According to eqn (S1) and (S2) (ESI†), the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) was calculated through the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) from the CVs in potential range of 1.2–1.3 V at different scan rates (Fig. S15, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3d, Co/Fe-SNC800 shows the highest Cdl value of 20.8 mF cm−2. Interestingly, Co-SNC800 also shows a high Cdl value of 18.0 mF cm−2, which is similar to that of Co/Fe-SNC800 but much higher than that of Fe-SNC800, suggesting that the Co sites may play the key role in the adsorption and activation of the reactants. As shown in Table S4 (ESI†), the ECSA value of Co/Fe-SNC800 is 0.0645 gcat−1, which is higher than that of Fe-SNC800 (0.0149 gcat−1) and Co-SNC800 (0.0513 gcat−1). Subsequently, the metal active site density (MASD) was calculated using eqn (S3) (ESI†) to evaluate the intrinsic activity of the metal sites and confirm the improved catalytic activity of the Co/Fe dual-metal sites. The MASD value of Co/Fe-SNC800 (1.15 × 1023 molmetal−1) is approximately 2-fold that of Fe-SNC800 (4.05 × 1022 molmetal−1) and Co-SNC800 (5.02 × 1022 molmetal−1) (Table S4, ESI†). The outstanding electrocatalytic activity of Co/Fe-SNC800 is also confirmed by its high turnover frequency (146 s−1 @ 10 mA cm−2, denoted as TOF, as described in SI), which is 2-fold that of Co-SNC800 (63 s−1@10 mA cm−2), as shown in Fig. 3e. Moreover, Co/Fe-SNC800 also shows an outstanding TOF at high overpotentials.\n",

    "# The catalytic OER pathway was further investigated using the rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) approach. The ring electrode potential was fixed at 1.5 V to monitor the generation of H2O2 generated the 2e− pathway, with the working mechanism illustrated in Fig. S17a (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S17b and c (ESI†), Co/Fe-SNC800 displays a higher Idisk and lower Iring than that of Fe-SNC800 and Co-SNC800, indicating the lower generation of H2O2 on Co/Fe-SNC800, respectively. Co/Fe-SNC800 demonstrates an electron transfer number (n) value of >3.5 with <25% H2O2 generation at potentials higher than 1.47 V (@10 mA cm−2), verifying the dominant 4e− OER pathway on Co/Fe-SNC800 (Fig. 3f). Therefore, the Co/Fe dual-atom-site speeds up the conversion of H2O2 or eliminates the 2e OER pathway, facilitating the selective production of O2. Meanwhile, the RRDE was also used to detect the O2 at the Pt ring electrode by setting it at the ORR potential (0.4 V), with the working mechanism illustrated in Fig. S18a (ESI†).51,52 The ORR current on the ring electrode increased fast upon the onset of the OER at the disk electrode and kept increasing with an increase in the disk potential, confirming the efficient production of O2 (Fig. S18b, ESI†). The Co/Fe-SNC800 catalyst showed a higher Iring, and hence more efficient O2 generation than that of Fe-SNC800 and Co-SNC800, indicating its outstanding 4e− OER activity. Chronopotentiometry was performed to evaluate the long-term stability of the catalysts. Co/Fe-SNC800 with the highest OER activity showed an almost negligible decrease in activity by maintaining the stable OER current at 20 mA cm−2 for 26 h (Fig. 3g). As shown in Fig. 3h, the Nyquist plot of Co/Fe-SNC800 shows a smaller quasi-semicircle than that of Co-SNC800, implying the lower electron transfer resistance in Co/Fe-SNC800, and hence its superior conductivity.\n",

    "# As shown in Fig. 3i, the Bode plots of the three catalysts, which indicate the frequency–responsive reaction processes, show distinct electrochemical reaction processes on the different catalytic surfaces under 1.6 V. Based on the above-mentioned findings, the Bode plots under varying potentials were recorded to identify the electrochemical processes during the OER catalytic reaction. As shown in Fig. 3i and 4a–c, three types of peaks are observed in the Bode plots under various applied potentials, which can be ascribed to three different surface reaction processes,53,54 as follows: (1) the adsorption capacitance in the high-frequency range in the vicinity of 104 Hz, originating from the most rapid relaxation process due to the adsorption of oxygen species (such as OH–); (2) the faradaic process at the intermediate-frequency range of 102 Hz, which is associated with the charge transfer impedance response; and (3) the double-layer capacitance in the low-frequency range below 10 Hz, which is controlled by the diffusion process. As shown in Fig. 4a, Fe-SNC800 exhibits an obviously high-frequency relaxation process, indicating the strong adsorption of oxygen species. In the electrochemical process, the Fe sites can be easily oxidized into FesiteOOH in alkaline media viaeqn (1), which may block the catalytic sites and hinder the subsequent catalytic process.55 The Bode plots of Co-SNC800 and Co/Fe-SNC800 show their sensitive dependence on the potential. As shown in Fig. 4b, Co-SNC800 exhibits a conversion from diffusion–faradaic mixed process at low potentials of 1.15–1.30 V to faradaic process at intermediate potentials of 1.40–1.60 V. The relatively weak OH− adsorption on the Co site in Co-SNC800 compared with the Fe site in Fe-SNC800 results in straightforward desorption from the Co site (eqn (S10), ESI†), making it difficult to form CositeOOH active species (eqn (S11), ESI†). Co/Fe-SNC800 displays an interfacial conversion from a pure diffusion process to faradaic process, as shown in Fig. 4c. The co-catalytic processes occur on both the Fe and Co sites in Co/Fe-SNC800, i.e., the excessive OH− species are strongly adsorbed on the Fesite to form FesiteOOH (eqn (1)), followed by reaction with the adjacent Cosite, further promoting the formation of highly active species CositeOOH (eqn (2)). The formation of FesiteOOH can lead to the transformation of the electronic structure around the Co/Fe dual-metal site, which makes the adjacent Co atoms unstable with high free energy. Thus, the Co atom tends to capture the ligand groups from the adjacent FesiteOOH at low potential under alkaline OER conditions to ensure its own stability by achieving the conversion from FesiteOOH to CositeOOH.56–60 Thus, a reasonable speculation for the OER catalytic mechanism on Co/Fe-SNC800 is proposed as the following eqn (1)–(3). As shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†), the co-catalysis between Fe and Co not only releases the excessive adsorbed OH− on the Fe sites but also accelerates the formation of CositeOOH active species, which can improve the OER activity through the synergistic effect.\n",

    "# Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was conducted as a semi-quantification method to assess the formation of OOH* active species as the key intermediate species in the 4e− pathway of OER. Fig. 4d shows the EPR signal of the OOH* radicals in the absence of an electric field. The characteristic peak intensity of the OOH* radical reflects the relative concentration of the free radicals using the same test conditions. The highest OOH* radical concentration of Co/Fe-SNC800 indicates its outstanding activity in generating OOH* active species. The concentration of OOH* increased with an increase in the potential (Fig. S20, ESI†). Furthermore, the adsorption and desorption of O2 were probed by O2-temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD). As shown in Fig. S21 (ESI†), the peak in the range of 400–550 °C can be attributed to the desorption of the chemically adsorbed O. The area of the desorbed O normalized by the MASD, which is known as the O affinity coefficient, was employed to assess the oxygen desorption capacity per metal site (Table S4, ESI†). The Fe sites show a higher O affinity coefficient than that of the Co sites. The Co/Fe dual-sites in Co/Fe-SNC800 show a moderate chemisorption O coefficient, which accelerates the reaction rate of the OER. The current response of the [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− redox pair was used as a descriptor to further assess the structure–function relationship of the catalysts in the OER. As shown in Fig. 4e, the pronounced redox peaks observed in the range of 0.8–0.9 V can be ascribed to the [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− redox pair. The highest current response of Co/Fe-SNC800 suggests the fastest electron transfer (I = Q/t, where I represents the current, Q is the total charge, and t is the reaction time). The lowest potential difference (Ea–Ec) and current difference on Co/Fe-SNC800 indicate that fast electron transfer and approximately reversible process occur (Fig. S22, ESI†). The Ea–Ec value, derived from the CV curves at various scan rates (Fig. 4f and Fig. S23a and b, ESI†), was plotted against the scan rate, as shown in Fig. 4g and Fig. S23c and d (ESI†). Different from the theoretical relationship that the Ea–Ec value is independent of the scan rate, the calculated Ea–Ec value is positively proportional to the scan rate, which can be attributed to the electron transfer between the metal atoms in the Co/Fe-SNC800 catalyst. The extrapolated Ea–Ec value at 2 mV s−1 was found to be 56.78 mV vs. the ideal reversible electrode at 56.52 mV, suggesting that the electron transfer at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 on Co/Fe-SNC800 is almost ideally reversible owing to the small charge transfer resistance. Additionally, the new redox peak observed in the range of 1.05∼1.25 V for Co-SNC800 can be attributed to the Co2+/Co3+ redox pair. However, the peaks of the Co2+/Co3+ redox pair disappear in Co/Fe-SNC800, possibly due to the electronic coupling between Fe and Co. The doping of Fe in Co-based materials decreases the surface Co2+/Co3+ ratio and the Co2+/Co3+ redox behavior, resulting in the disappearance of the Co2+/Co3+ redox peaks. In addition, the [Fe(CN)6]3− in the electrolyte can chelate with the incompletely coordinated Co atom in the FeN3-CoN2S site on the surface of Co/Fe-SNC800, which can also contribute to the disappearance of the Co2+/Co3+ redox peaks.61–69\n",

    "# The previous results strongly indicated the electronic coupling between the Co and Fe sites from various aspects, which was further revealed in the microscopy investigations. Thus, the time-continuum HAADF-STEM strategy with a series of images was employed in a time sequence to look into the structural evolution of the metal sites. The continuously captured images in 2.0 seconds on Region 2 (Fig. 4h) reveal a variation in the distance between the two adjacent metal atoms, indicating that there is no chemical bonding correlation between two adjacent metal sites. Further analysis of the intensity profile suggests that the two adjacent metal atoms vibrate elastically within a certain range (Fig. 4i and Fig. S24, ESI†), which presents further evidence of the existence of dual-atom sites (Co–Fe dual-single-atom) with weak interactions, rather than the accidental combination of two independent single-atom sites. These dual-atom sites verified the electronic coupling effect between Fe and Co. The adjacent metal atoms can self-organize their configuration through electronic coupling, and thus their electronic structure is based on that of the adsorption species, which can effectively optimize the adsorption and desorption of the atoms or molecules and the active intermediates.70–72\n",
    "\n",
    "# Subsequently, first-principle density functional theory calculation was employed to understand the mechanism of the remarkable OER performances of Co/Fe-SNC. For the bonding orbitals and anti-bonding orbitals near the Fermi level (EF), it can be noticed that Co/Fe-SNC exhibits strong orbital coupling, especially near the Co and Fe SA sites (Fig. 5a). The Co–Fe SA sites form highly electroactive regions with electron-rich features. The orbital coupling involves the hybridizations of dz2, dx2−y2, and dyz of the Co and Fe sites to support the highly efficient electron transfer. In comparison, the coupling between the SA sites is absent in Co-SNC and Fe-SNC, leading to weakened site-to-site electron transfer in their lattice (Fig. 5b and c). Moreover, Fe-SNC displays stronger anti-bonding orbitals than bonding orbitals, which further reduces its overall electroactivity. The detailed electronic structures of the catalysts were displayed through the projected partial density of states (PDOSs). In the case of Co/Fe-SNC, the Co-3d orbitals exhibit a sharp peak close to the Fermi level at EV of −0.33 eV (EV = 0 eV), indicating its high electroactivity for the OER with strong electron depletion capability (Fig. 5d). The Fe-3d orbital shows eg–t2g splitting, which pins the Co-3d orbitals at the highly active position to guarantee a remarkable OER performance. Meanwhile, the strong overlapping among the N-2p, C-2p, and S-3p orbitals acts as the electron supply center to achieve efficient site-to-site electron transfer in Co/Fe-SNC. In the case of Co-SNC, it was observed that different Co sites display distinct electronic structures (Fig. 5e). The Co sites coordinated with S are beneficial for high electroactivity, while the coordination with N sites leads to a downshift in the 3d orbitals, resulting in decreased electroactivity. In comparison, both types of Fe-3d orbitals exhibit evident eg–t2g splitting near EF, revealing an electron transfer barrier for the OER process (Fig. 5f). The p orbitals of the SNC structure show very little change among the different electrocatalysts. To further evaluate the electroactivity, the d-band center was compared, where Co/Fe-SNC possesses superior electroactivity because it possesses the highest d-band center at EV of −0.86 eV (Fig. 5g). The d-band center of Fe/SNC and Co/SNC is EV = −0.88 eV and EV = −1.01 eV, respectively. Interestingly, we observed that the integration of Fe and Co SA sites in Co/Fe -SNC induced an increase in their d-band center, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect induced by the d–d orbital coupling. The 3d orbitals of Fe protect the Co sites during the OER to maintain the high electroactivity towards the reactants and intermediates. The PDOS of the key adsorbates during the OER are shown in Fig. 5h and i. Co/Fe-SNC showed a slightly stronger linear correlation than that of Co-SNC for the intermediate conversion process from H2O to O2, which corroborates the more efficient electron transfer process with experimentally discovered lower overpotential for Co/Fe-SNC. Moreover, the main deviation in the linear correlation of PDOS evolution occurs at O* and OOH*, which indicates that the conversion of O* to OOH* is the potential rate-determining step (RDS) of the OER.\n",

    "# From an energetic perspective, we demonstrated a comparison of the binding energy and energy cost of OOH* transfer in Fig. S25 (ESI†). The adsorption of OH* and O* is more energetically favored on the Fe sites, which is consistent with the experimental characterization (Fig. S25a, ESI†). The transfer of OOH* from the Fe site to the Co sites is overall spontaneous with a negative energy change of −0.81 eV (Fig. S25b, ESI†). Moreover, the transient state of OOH* transfer only shows an energy cost of 0.11 eV, which guarantees the fast transfer of OOH* to promote the OER performance. These results support the reaction mechanisms characterized by experiments. Finally, the reaction energy change of the OER for both Co/Fe-SNC and Co-SNC were further compared. Under U = 0 V, for both electrocatalysts, the OER process exhibited an overall uphill trend for the energy change (Fig. 5j). The largest energy barrier of the OER is the conversion from [2OH− + H2O + O*] to [OH− + H2O + OOH*] as the RDS, which is consistent with electronic structure results. Co/Fe-SNC has an energy barrier of 1.46 eV for the RDS, which is much smaller than that of Co-SNC, confirming the improved electroactivity of Co/Fe-SNC. After applying the equilibrium potential of 1.23 V, the overpotential of the OER was estimated to be 0.23 eV and 0.38 eV for Co/Fe-SNC and Co-SNC, respectively, agreeing well with the experimental results (Fig. 5k). Meanwhile, the reaction energy change of the comparison samples Fe/Co-NC and Fe/Co-SC was also revealed (Fig. S26, ESI†). Notably, both catalysts show higher energy costs than the Co/Fe SNC catalyst, revealing their synergistic contributions to the electroactivity. Co/Fe-NC shows the RDS at the conversion from OH* to O*, while Co/Fe-SC demonstrates the RDS at the initial adsorption of OH* (Fig. S26a, ESI†). Under the equilibrium potential, the overpotential of Co/Fe-NC and Co/Fe-SC is 0.43 V and 0.37 V, respectively (Fig. S26b, ESI†). These results further revealed that the introduction of both S and N atoms is important to achieve superior OER performances.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "# In summary, a Co/Fe-SNC dual-metal catalyst was designed and synthesized in this work via the reverse micellar assembly strategy followed by pyrolysis. The optimized catalyst Co/Fe-SNC800 showed high electrocatalytic activity towards the OER with an overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm−2, as well as long-term stability with a negligible decrease in activity at 20 mA cm−2 for 26 h. The mechanism for the catalytic enhancement was systematically investigated through experiments, whereby the Cosite was found to initiate the activation of the reactants into intermediate species. The electron-coupling between Fe and Co not only could reduce the adsorption of oxygen species on the Fe sites but also accelerate the formation of CositeOOH active species. Fesite served as the auxiliary site to expedite the conversion of the intermediate species of CositeOOH into the final product. DFT calculation revealed the optimized electronic structure induced by the d–d orbital coupling between the Fe and Co sites, which increased the electroactivity towards the conversion of intermediate species and sustained a robust valence state of active sites for the OER process. The synergistic effect of the Fe and Co SA sites led to a significantly reduced overpotential for the OER on Co/Fe-SNC. This work presents critical insight into the role of the Fe sites in the Co/Fe dual-metal catalyst for the OER, as well as a new proof-of-concept methodology for the precise control of the synergistic effect of dual-metal sites.\n",

    "# Preparation and morphological characterization of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC\n",
    "# Based on the theoretical predictions, we precisely synthesized N, P, and S ternary co-doped hollow carbon nanocages with the Fe–N4SP configuration (Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC), followed by performance testing and mechanistic validation. The preparation procedure of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Initially, ZIF-8/FePc@PZS was synthesized by adding iron phthalocyanine (FePc) into the typical zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-8) followed by coating with a uniform layer of phosphonitrile polymer (PZS) on its surface. This method allowed the encapsulation of FePc in the cavity of ZIF-8 without a change in the crystal structure (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†) and the thickness of the PZS shell layer is about 20 nm (Fig. 2(b)). Afterward, Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC was fabricated by one-step pyrolysis and acid etching of ZIF-8/FePc@PZS, in which doped N served as the effective anchoring sites for the Fe atom, while abundant P and S elements in PZS were synchronously doped into the carbon shell. Additionally, the S element was also directly and axially bonded to the Fe atom to modulate the electronic structure of Fe–N4. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of Fe–N4SP/NPS-HC in Fig. 2(c), (d) and Fig. S8 (ESI†) displayed a hollow carbon nanocage without any lattice striations, revealing Fe moieties present as single atoms or tiny clusters. Such a unique hollow structure would maximize the accessibility of the active sites to the electrolyte, as well as facilitate ion transport and mass transfer during electrocatalysis.45–47 Furthermore, only a broad carbon peak (at 24.4°) was observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, proving the complete etching of FeP caused by pyrolysis (Fig. S8b, ESI†). The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) also confirmed uniformly dispersed Fe species as individual atoms throughout the hollow carbon shell (Fig. 2(e)). Additionally, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping illustrated the presence of well-distributed C, N, P, S, and Fe elements throughout the entire carbon matrix (Fig. 2(f)). Among them, the elemental contents of Fe, P, and S were determined to be 1.33%, 3.90%, and 2.15%, respectively (Table S1, ESI†).\n",
