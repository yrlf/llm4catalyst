However, the electrocatalytic performance of carbon nitride is limited by its low conductivity. In order to circumference this limitation, we incorporated g-C3N4 with nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G) by ball-milling g-C3N4 and N-G to produce g-C3N4@N-G of an ORR catalytic activity comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst, along with a better long-term stability and more tolerance to the methanol crossover effect.\nInstead of burning fossil fuels, fuel cells can convert chemical energy directly into electricity by reducing oxygen gas at cathode and oxidizing hydrogen gas at anode with water as the only by-product and free from pollution. Due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), catalysts are required for ORR. Platinum (Pt) has been known to be the best electrocatalyst for the cathodic oxygen reduction. However, commercial Pt/C catalysts are still suffered from multiple drawbacks, including their high cost, limited reserve, sluggish kinetics, and susceptible to the methanol crossover/CO poisoning effect. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop new low-cost, high-performance ORR catalysts to reduce/replace the commercial Pt/C catalysts for practical applications\n[1]\n.\nWe have previously demonstrated that heteroatom-doped carbon materials could act as metal-free catalysts with superb ORR activities. Examples include N-doped carbon nanotubes\n[2]\n,\n[3]\n, N-doped graphene (N-G)\n[4]\n, BCN graphene\n[5]\n, and N, P co-doped VACNTs\n[6]\n. Among them, nitrogen-doping has been demonstrated to be most effective to improve the ORR electrocatalytic activities of carbon nanomaterials. In this regard, carbon nitrides with a high nitrogen content is very promising metal-free electrocatalysts. Carbon nitrides have different crystal structures, including tetrahedral carbon nitride (b-C3N4) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). b-C3N4 is predicted to possess a high hardness and low compressibility similar as diamond while g-C3N4 is regarded as the most stable allotrope at ambient conditions\n[7]\n. For g-C3N4, two structural isomers have been identified: one comprises condensed melamine units containing a periodic array of single carbon vacancies; the other is made up of condensed melem (2,5,8,-triamino-tri-s-triazine) subunits containing larger periodic vacancies in the lattice\n[8]\n. Recently, carbon nitrides have been proved to be effective catalysts for water splitting under visible light\n[9]\n, splitting of CO2\n[10]\n, and cyclotrimerization of various nitriles\n[11]\n. However, the electrocatalytic performance of carbon nitride for ORR was found to be very poor due to its low conductivity\n[8]\n. In order to improve the electrocatalytic activity of g-C3N4, various carbon materials have been used as the support to enhance charge-transfer, and hence the catalytic performance of g-C3N4. Examples include the combined g-C3N4 and carbon black\n[8]\n,\n[12]\n, g-C3N4 immobilized graphene sheets\n[13]\n,\n[14]\n,\n[15]\n, g-C3N4 incorporated mesoporous carbon (CMK-3)\n[16]\n,\n[17]\n, and 3D ordered macroporous",

Of particular interest, N-G is a promising candidate for supporting carbon nitride to enhance the electron transfer, though yet reported.\nIn collaboration, we have previously used ball milling technique for low-cost, scalable production of various edge-functionalized graphene materials, including nitrogen-edge-doped graphene, as metal-free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction\n[20]\n,\n[21]\n,\n[22]\n,\n[23]\n. Herein, we report new metal-free ORR electrocatalysts based on N-G and g-C3N4 hybrid materials (g-C3N4@N-G) produced by ball milling g-C3N4 prepared from pyrolysis of cyanamide under a flow of argon gas and N-doped graphene from modified Hummer’s method.\nThe graphitic carbon nitride was prepared by pyrolysis of cyanamide under a flow of argon gas. In a typical experiment, the cyanamide precursor was placed into a quartz boat, which was then inset into a quartz tube in a muffle furnace. Thereafter, the quartz tube was gradually heated up to 550 °C within 2 h and kept at 550 °C for additional 4 h under the flow of argon gas (200 sccm), followed by air cooling down to room temperature while kept the argon flowing through inside of the quartz tube\n[18]\n,\n[19]\n.\nGraphene oxide was prepared using the modified Hummers’ method\n[24]\n. Typically, graphite powder (3.0 g) was added into a mixture solution of concentrated H2SO4 (70 mL) and NaNO3 (1.5 g) in an ice bath. To the resulting mixture, KMnO4 (9.0 g) was added slowly, followed by stirring at 35 °C for 2 h. Then the newly-produced mixture was added into deionized water (150 mL) slowly, which was poured into 500 mL deionized water containing 15 mL 30% H2O2. After filtration, the solid component was recovered from the mixture and washed by HCl (10 wt.%) and deionized water. The resultant solid was then added into water and sonicated for 1 h for exfoliation of graphene oxide. The graphene oxide dispersion thus produced was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min, and the graphene oxide was recovered by freeze drying of the supernatant according to published procedures (typically, freeze-drying at 10 mTorr for 3 days)\n[25]\n.\nFollowing our previous work\n[26]\n, we prepared nitrogen-doped graphene by annealing the freeze-dried graphene oxide in a quartz tube furnace under ammonia/argon gas mixture (NH3:Ar = 1:1 v/v, 200 sccm) at 800 °C for 1 h.\ng-C3N4@N-G was prepared by ball milling g-C3N4 and N-G (1:3 wt/wt). Briefly, g-C3N4 (10 mg) was first dispersed in 20 mL DI-water and sonicated for 20 min, which was placed together with N-G (30 mg) into a stainless steel container with 100 g stainless steel balls of 5-mm in diameter. The container was then fixed in a planetary ball-mill machine and agitated with 500 rpm for 24 h. The resultant product was washed with HCl (10 wt.%) to remove metal impurities, if any, and then collected by filtration and vacuum drying. g-C3N4⋅N-G mixture was prepared simply by mixing 10 mg g-C3N4 and 30 mg N-G in 20 mL DI-water under stirring for 24 h, followed by filtration and vacuum drying.\nTransmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were taken using a JEOL2100 high resolution transmission electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.

Raman spectra were collected on a Raman spectrometer (Renishaw) using 514 nm laser. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA instrument (Q50) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in air.\nElectrochemical measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760C, CH Instrument) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell at room temperature. A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was used as the reference electrode. The catalyst with a loading amount of 200 μg/cm2 was drop-cast onto the glass carbon electrode (CH Instrument, d = 0.5 cm), followed by casting with 10 μL Nafion solution (0.05 wt.% in ethanol) as the binder. Catalytic activities of the electrocatalysts were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) techniques on rotating disk electrodes (RDEs) in an oxygen saturated aqueous solution of 0.1 M KOH at room temperature.\nFig. 1\n(a) shows a typical TEM image of the g-C3N4 while\nFig. 1\n(b) reproduces a TEM image for the wrinkled N-G sheets. The TEM image for the ball-milled g-C3N4@N-G is given in\nFig. 1\n(c), which shows that the g-C3N4 nanosheets were uniformly distributed on the N-G sheets with an intimate contact between them – an advantage for conductivity enhancement of the g-C3N4 nanosheets, and hence their electrocatalytic activities. A comparison of\nFig. 1\n(a) with\nFig. 1\n(c) shows that the g-C3N4 sheets were mechanically cracked into smaller nanosheets and then deposited onto the N-G sheets during the ball milling process.\nFig. 1. TEM images of (a) C3N4 (scale bar: 100 nm), (b) N-G (scale bar: 500 nm), and (c) C3N4@N-G (scale bar: 100 nm).\nFig. 2\n(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for g-C3N4, N-G and g-C3N4@N-G. As expected, g-C3N4 shows a strong peak at 27.4°, corresponding to the in-plane ordering of tri-s-triazine units\n[27]\n. The interlayer-stacking peak around 13.0°\n[27]\nis largely absent, indicating the lack of a through-thickness order. The N-G shows a relatively broad peak at around 26.2° characteristic of graphitic carbons while g-C3N4@N-G shows a similar peak at around 26.4° with a slight up-shift. This, together with the appearance of a broad band, albeit very weak, centered around 13°, indicates the successful deposition of g-C3N4 onto the graphene sheets to restore the through-thickness order to a certain degree. The structural order of g-C3N4@N-G was further investigated using Raman spectroscopy with respect to N-G. As can be seen in\nFig. 2\n(b), a D-band at around 1356 cm−1 and G-band at around 1588 cm−1 were observed for both N-G and g-C3N4@N-G. The peak intensity ratio of the D-band to G-band (ID/IG) was estimated to be about 0.94 and 0.99 for N-G and g-C3N4@N-G, respectively. The observed increase in the ID/IG ratio indicates that more defects were introduced on the graphene basal plane due to the deposition of g-C",

The observed increase in the ID/IG ratio indicates that more defects were introduced on the graphene basal plane due to the deposition of g-C3N4 nanosheets – an additional advantage for electrocatalysis. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to investigate the thermo stability of g-C3N4@N-G and its constituent components (i.e., g-C3N4, N-G). As seen in\nFig. 2\n(c), g-C3N4 exhibited a decomposition temperature at around 650 °C whereas the N-G and g-C3N4@N-G decomposed at a lower temperature (ca. 600 °C). Furthermore, the g-C3N4@N-G showed a lower thermo stability over 300–600 °C due, most probably, to the increased defects associated with the deposition of g-C3N4 onto the N-G sheets, in a good agreement with the Raman results.\nFig. 2.

The corresponding XPS spectra for g-C3N4 and N-G were given in\nFig. S1\n. All of the XPS spectra show a pronounced C 1s peak, along with a N 1s and O 1s peak. As we shall see later, the O 1s peak arises mainly from physically adsorbed oxygen since graphitic carbon is known to be susceptible to oxygen adsorption even at pressures as low as 10−8 to 10−10 Torr\n[28]\n, typical for the XPS measurements. The strong oxygen adsorption capacity offers an additional advantage for ORR electrocatalysis. As can be seen in\nFig. S1(b)\n, the C1s spectrum of g-C3N4 shows two main carbon component peaks at the binding energies of 284.6 and 288.0 eV, corresponding to C–N–C and C–(N)3, respectively\n[27]\n. On the other hand, N1s spectrum of g-C3N4 given in\nFig. S1(c)\nshows two peaks at around 398.8 and 401.0 eV corresponding to pyridinic-N and graphitic-N, respectively, in consistent with the molecular structure of g-C3N4\n[29]\n. The high resolution N1s spectrum of N-G given in\nFig. S1(f)\nwas deconvoluted into three peaks at 398.6, 400.5 and 405.7 eV corresponding to the pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N and N-oxides, respectively\n[26]\n,\n[30]\nwhile the corresponding C1s spectrum in\nFig. S1(e)\ncould be fitted into CC, C–C and C–N with no O-containing peak component, indicating no oxygen-bonded carbon (vide supra). The C1s spectrum of g-C3N4@N-G given in\nFig. 2\n(e) could also be deconvoluted into a dominated peak for sp2-C at 284.6 eV, along with the other two weaker peaks associated with sp3-C at 285.6 eV, C–N at 286.0 eV, respectively, with no O-containing peak component, indicating once again that physical adsorption is responsible for",

The N1s spectrum of g-C3N4@N-G shown in\nFig. 2\n(f) was fitted to pyridinic-N at ∼398.6 eV, pyrrolic-N at ∼400.6 eV, graphitic-N at ∼401.0 eV and N-oxides at ∼405.7 eV, respectively\n[31]\n. Overall, the XPS spectra of g-C3N4@N-G exhibited the characteristic peaks of both g-C3N4 and N-G, indicating an intimate combination of the N-G with g-C3N4 by ball milling, as also revealed by the TEM examination (cf.\nFig. 1\n(c)).\nThe incorporation of N-G into g-C3N4 or vice versa could increase the electrical conductivity and nitrogen content (\nFig. 2\n(d), 8.9% of g-C3N4@N-G vs. 4.0% for N-G.\nFig. S1(d)\n) of the catalyst, leading to improved ORR electrocatalysis. The ORR electrocatalytic activity of g-C3N4@N-G was tested by conventional three-electrode cyclic voltammetry (CV) in O2 and N2 saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solutions, respectively.\nFig. S2(a)\nshows that a characteristic ORR peak starting at about −0.10 V was observed for oxygen reduction on the g-C3N4@N-G electrode in the O2 saturated 0.1 M KOH, but not in the N2 saturated 0.1 M KOH. For comparison, the CV curves of g-C3N4 and N-G were shown in\nFigs. 3\n(a) and\nS2(b)\n, along with the corresponding curve for g-C3N4@N-G. As can be seen, the peak intensity of g-C3N4@N-G, with a more positive onset potential, is much stronger than those of N-G and g-C3N4, indicating a more effective ORR process on the g-C3N4@N-G electrode. A series of linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) for g-C3N4, N-G and g-C3N4@N-G were measured on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) from 400 to 1600 rpm, showing an typically increased current with increasing rotation speeds (\nFig. 3\n(b)).\nFig. 3\n(b) shows an increased ORR onset potential and enhanced limited current density in the order of g-C3N4 < N-G < g-C3N4@N-G in good agreement with the CV results, indicating a synergistic effect for g-C3N4@N-G as the ORR catalyst. Due to the low quality of the N-G produced from the GO precursor with respected to those produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)\n[4]\n,\n[33]\n,\n[34]\n, relatively poor electrocatalytic performance was observed for the N-G in\nFig. 3\n(b).\nFig. 3.

From\nFig. 3\n(c), the electron transfer number was calculated to be about 4.0\n[2]\n,\n[4]\n,\n[32]\n, indicating a four-electron ORR process. In addition, the transferred electron numbers per O2 were also determined by the Koutecky–Levich equation\n[32]\n, as shown in the supporting information. From the K–L plots shown in\nFigs. 3\n(d) and\nS2(d, e)\n, the electron transfer number (n) of g-C3N4, N-G and g-C3N4@N-G at different potential were presented in\nFig. 3\n(e). As can be seen, g-C3N4@N-G showed n = 4.0, which is in good agreement with the corresponding value estimated from RRDE, whereas the N-G and g-C3N4 exhibited n = 3.1 and 2.0, respectively. Clearly, the combination of g-C3N4 and N-G has greatly enhanced the oxygen reduction process on the g-C3N4@N-G electrode.\nAs shown in\nFig. S2(c)\n, the ORR onset potentials of g-C3N4, N-G, and g-C3N4@N-G are about −0.31 V, −0.15 V and −0.02 V (E vs. SCE), respectively. Similarly, the ORR half-wave potential (E1/2) of g-C3N4@N-G is about −0.22 V (E vs. SCE), which is much better than that of g-C3N4 (E1/2 ≈ −0.44 V) and N-G (E1/2 ≈ −0.40 V).\nFig. S2(c)\nshows an ORR catalytic activity comparable to the commercial Pt/C catalyst for g-C3N4@N-G. In a control experiment, the g-C3N4 and N-G mixture was also prepared by simply stirring mixing for 24 h without ball milling, which was demonstrated to show an inferior ORR performance than g-C3N4@N-G (\nFig. S2(c)\n), indicating that ball milling played an important role in improving the catalytic activity.\nThe g-C3N4@N-G electrode was further subjected to stability assessment and tested for possible methanol crossover effect. As shown in\nFig. 4\n(a), the original cathodic ORR current of g-C3N4@N-G at −0.3 V did not show a significant change after the sequential addition of methanol into the electrolyte solution (a total methanol concentration of 3 M), suggesting that g-C3N4@N-G is free from the methanol crossover effect. In contrast, the commercial Pt/C showed an immediate change upon the addition of methanol, indicating a conversion of the dominated oxygen reduction to the methanol oxidation reaction, which can be considered as a poisoning of the catalyst. The durability of g-C3N4@N-G was evaluated by the chronoamperometric response at −0.3 V. As shown in\nFig. 4\n(b), the metal-free g-C3N4@N-G catalyst exhibited high stability with a very slow attenuation and a high current retention (96.3%) even after 30,000 s, showing a much better",

To the best of our knowledge, g-C3N4@N-G showed the best performance among the carbon nitride based electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction, as seen in\nTable S1\n.\nFig. 4.

The resultant g-C3N4@N-G exhibited excellent catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction, comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst, with an onset potential at about −0.02 V (E vs. SCE) and half-wave potential at about −0.22 V (E vs. SCE). The superb ORR performance observed for the g-C3N4@N-G could be attributed to the synergetic effect arising from the ball-milling-induced intimate combination of nitrogen-rich g-C3N4 and N-G with a good conductivity.
