  "0": "Introduction\nChemical energy is converted to electric power in fuel cells (FCs) without forming harmful combustion products, and thus, holds great promise as an important clean energy technology. (1) Therefore, considerable efforts have been made to promote the electrochemical performance of FCs, which is mainly limited by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a cathode. (2) Traditional platinum-loaded carbon (Pt/C) materials are considered as the most active electrocatalysts for the ORR; however, these materials face issues such as prohibitive cost, low natural abundance, poor durability, and susceptibility to interference from some fuels (methanol, carbon monoxide, etc.). (3−5) As a result, the research community has been working to develop low-cost, efficient, and stable substitutes. In recent years, new approaches have been developed for syntheses based on less precious-metal materials or Pt-based alloys; however, these strategies are far from satisfying the need for commercialization.\nTo escape from the dependence on traditional catalysts based on noble metals, metal-free materials have recently drawn attention owing to their excellent electrocatalytic activity, cost effectiveness, and durability. These materials have been used to fabricate electrodes with the aim of improving the ORR performance. (6−8) Among these materials, carbon nitride (CN) stands out as a nitrogen-rich carbon material that exhibits remarkable catalytic performance and is already applied in hydrogen production and degradation of pollutants. (9) The electrocatalytic activity of CN is primarily related to the relatively high nitrogen proportion in its structure. (9,10) A positive charge on adjacent carbon atoms was induced because of the high content of nitrogen, facilitating the adsorption of oxygen molecules and subsequently weakening the O–O bonding. (9,11) Thus, CN that is rich in nitrogen holds great promise as an efficient ORR electrocatalyst. Furthermore, this material is inexpensive, environmentally benign, and can be synthesized by simple methods from a range of simple precursors, (12,13) suggesting great potential for practical applications. However, despite the superiority of CN as a competitive ORR electrocatalyst, its applications have been limited by its semiconductive nature, which hinders electron transportation during oxygen reduction processes. The ORR proceeds through a pathway of four electrons rather than two electrons indirectly. Therefore, there is need to improve the poor electroconductivity of CN. Recently, integrating a carbon material with CN has been reported to improve the electron transfer and increase the number of active sites. (11−14) However, the ORR efficiency has yet to reach its potential owing to a comparatively low surface area and deficiency of exposed active sites. Therefore, integrating a carbon-based support and CN is likely to combine their respective advantages and provide a material with unique properties in the resulting metal-free hybrids.\nNitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) have been considered as promising catalysts, which feature a lot of outstanding characteristics compared with those of pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs). (15,16) Doping with nitrogen can tune the physicochemical properties of CNTs and promote their electroconductivity. (17,18) Additionally, nitrogen-doped components are chemically active and create defects that negate the inherent inertness of CNTs, and thus, increase the surface chemical reactivity of the material. (19) Therefore, NCNTs can be applied as an efficient support material to fabricate electrocatalysts. Furthermore, owing to the unique structure of NCNTs, with large specific surface areas and natural channels, NCNT-supported materials also have large surface areas, which will increase the adsorption ability of the resulting composite. This feature will benefit ORR catalysis because oxygen adsorption is a key factor affecting the electrocatalytic efficiency. (20)\nTo date, CN spread over the NCNT surface and its application in catalyzing the ORR under alkaline conditions have not been reported. In this work, a metal-free CN/NCNT composite was fabricated by a simple heating process. The obtained CN/NCNT material had outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the ORR, superior tolerance to crossover effects, and excellent long-term stability.\nMaterials and Methods\nMaterial Synthesis\nIn a typical synthesis of the CN/NCNT composite, 2.0 g of cyanamide powder was first dispersed in doubly distilled water in order to obtain the cyanamide solution. 0.1 g of NCNTs, which was prepared by the method used in the previous study, (16) was then dropped into the solution, followed by continuous vigorous stirring at 50 °C to drive away most of the aqueous solvent.

When most of the water evaporated, the resultant slurry was transferred to a drying oven under vacuum at 80 °C to completely remove water. The dried mixture was ground in a pestle and mortar for approximately 30 min before it was heated at 550 °C with an argon gas flow for 4 h prior to cooling. The resulting powder was then washed with water and ethanol. At last, the CN/NCNT powder was dried at 65 °C overnight. The NCNT content was ca. 5.0% in the obtained product. For reference, cyanamide was also treated by the same procedure, after which bulk CN formed. Based on the procedure for CN/NCNT synthesis, it can be found that the polymerization of cyanamide, a typical precursor of CN, proceeded on the surface of NCNTs as a support. Subsequently, the CN material formed around the NCNTs, which produced a close interface between the two components and an enlarged surface area and was an advantage for integrating a carbon-based support with CN to form a new material with more exposed active sites compared with those reported in the literature. (11,12,14)\nCharacterization\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded to reveal the crystal structures of the samples. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were gained to identify the morphology of the current electrocatalysts. The surface area was obtained using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis was performed on a Nicolet 5700 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were carried out with a monochromic Al Kα X-ray source.\nElectrochemical tests were performed on an Autolab PGSTAT 302N workstation. A glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode which was coated with CN/NCNTs, CN, or Pt/C (Pt content: ca. 20%) was applied as a working electrode. An Ag/AgCl electrode was used as a reference electrode and a platinum wire as a counter electrode. 0.1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution was used as the electrolyte for voltammogram measurements. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted in an O2-saturated electrolyte over the rotation from 625 to 2025 rpm. Chronoamperometry was applied here to examine the stability of the samples. Rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) voltammograms were recorded on a GC ring-disk electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed by applying a sine wave with an amplitude of 10 mV over the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz. The scan rate was 0.05 V/s for all electrochemical analyses unless stated. The KOH solution saturated with O2 for electrochemical experiments was obtained by bubbling pure oxygen gas for 1 h.\nElectrode Preparation\nA 20 mg portion of the catalyst powder was mixed with 1 mL Nafion solution as a binding agent (5 wt % Nafion in water), followed by sonication for 5 min. Thereafter, the resultant slurry was pipetted onto the pretreated GC (or the disk part when performing the RRDE measurements) and dried under vacuum to acquire the working electrode.\nResults and Discussion\nCharacteristics of CN/NCNT Composite\nPowder XRD pattern results exhibited the structural variation of the as-prepared CN/NCNTs and the pure CN. As shown in Figure 1, two intense peaks at ca. 13.0 and 27.3° were clearly detected from CN, which originated from the in-plane distance between the nitride pores and the unique graphite-like stacking structure of the conjugated CN layers, respectively. (21,22) Through the introduction of a small amount of NCNTs, peaks emerged at approximately 26.3, 43.0, and 52.0° in the pattern of the as-prepared material, which are representative of the characteristic crystal faces for NCNTs (002, 100/101, and 004, respectively). (23) The peak for NCNTs at 26.3° was difficult to observe because of some overlap with the peak at 27.3° of CN. Additionally, the appearance",

(23) The peak for NCNTs at 26.3° was difficult to observe because of some overlap with the peak at 27.3° of CN. Additionally, the appearance of the (004) peak at approximately 52.0° demonstrated good crystallinity and a high average number of CN layers. The as-prepared composite had enhanced diffraction intensity following the introduction of NCNTs, which is indicative of higher crystallinity and fewer defects in the composite. Therefore, it can be confirmed from the above-mentioned results that the synthesis in this study was successful.\nFigure 1\nFigure 1. Powder XRD pattern of the synthesized CN/NCNT material and CN.\nThe morphology of the CN/NCNT material was revealed by SEM and TEM imaging. According to the synthesis strategy, a condensation reaction of cyanamide took place on the NCNT surface, which resulted in the gradual growth of a homogeneous CN network around the hollow cylinders of the NCNT. Therefore, the CN/NCNT material had a unique morphology, giving rise to the formation of an intimate interface between CN and the NCNT. Figure 2a,b shows the typical morphology of the bulk CN and indicates a large quantity of CN particles aggregated together and a characteristic lamellar structure. These common features of pristine CN materials are typically associated with low specific surface areas. However, the impregnation of a small amount of NCNTs markedly altered the surface properties of the composite. Figure 2c,d shows that the surface of the CN/NCNT composite becomes more uneven, and the composite itself was more porous compared with that of the pristine CN material. The NCNTs were tightly covered with CN particles owing to the polymerization of cyanamide around individual NCNTs. TEM images of the composite confirmed that NCNTs were dispersed in the composite (Figure 2e) and a CN layer was distinguishable growing around a NCNT (Figure 2f). This structure is likely to have a large surface area owing to the presence of NCNTs and will benefit from O2 absorption.\nFigure 2\nFigure 2. SEM images of bulk CN (a,b) and CN/NCNTs (c,d); TEM images of CN/NCNTs (e,f).\nThe surface areas of the CN/NCNT composite and that of the pristine CN were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption analysis (Figure 3). Previous reports have confirmed that CN has a relatively small surface area because of its lamellar morphology. (24,25) The specific surface area of the CN/NCNT composite was 2.3 times that of pristine CN (26.7 vs 11.6 m2 g–1), which is mainly attributed to the presence of NCNTs. The introduction of the NCNTs changed the aggregation and stacking behavior of the CN making it grow around the NCNT surfaces, resulting in a more wrinkled morphology of the composite surface. Moreover, adsorption isotherms of the CN/NCNT composite showed a clear type-IV behavior at relatively high pressures, which indicates the existence of a certain quantity of mesopores. (26) Nevertheless, despite the mesopores in the NCNTs, no pronounced variation in the pore size between the composite and CN was found, suggesting that a small amount of NCNTs did not notably change the porosity of the composite. This is likely because the mesopores in the NCNTs were blocked by CN, as verified by the abovementioned SEM images (Figure 2c). Therefore, the enlarged specific surface area of the composite and its high porosity are ideal features for ORR electrocatalysts and might improve the absorption ability of the composite in terms of oxygen capture. (19)\nFigure 3\nFigure 3. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm of the CN/NCNT composite. Inset: Corresponding pore size distributions.\nThe elemental composition and the chemical bonding of carbon and nitrogen species were explored by XPS. XPS survey spectra indicated the presence of C, N, and O in the composite and of pure CN (Figure 4a,b). The high N content of the composite is attributed to the introduction of NCNTs during its synthesis. Furthermore, the peak areas of C 1s and N 1s suggested that N/C (atomic ratio) in the CN/NCNT material was approximately 49.7%, which is much higher than that of pristine CN (27.6%). Carbon materials with higher N/C values have",

Furthermore, the peak areas of C 1s and N 1s suggested that N/C (atomic ratio) in the CN/NCNT material was approximately 49.7%, which is much higher than that of pristine CN (27.6%). Carbon materials with higher N/C values have been reported to possess superior physicochemical properties, such as high electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity. (27)\nFigure 4\nFigure 4. XPS spectra of CN (a) and CN/NCNT (b) materials; high-resolution N 1s spectra of CN (c) and CN/NCNTs (d); C 1s spectrum (e) and nitrogen content (f) of CN/NCNTs.\nNitrogen content is an important factor for electrocatalysts, and the density of catalytic sites is directly related to the N content. (28) Therefore, N 1s spectra of both CN/NCNTs and CN are given in Figure 4c,d. The signal was fitted by three peaks at binding energies of 399.0, 400.1, and 401.5 eV, which correspond to pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic N, respectively. (11) In the synthesized composite, pyridinic N is the main component and makes up approximately 54.0% of the total N content (29.7%), which is considerably more than that of pristine CN. The high pyridinic N content provides the as-prepared composite with unique physicochemical properties. First, pyridinic sites in the material are responsible for the roughness of the surface owing to the unique pyridinic structure. (22) Therefore, the CN/NCNT composite is estimated to have a rough morphology based on its high pyridinic N content. More importantly, it has also been reported that pyridinic N is crucial for electrocatalytic reactions in the ORR owing to its strong electron-accepting capability which favor oxygen adsorption and also attract electrons. (29) Therefore, the CN/NCNT composite with a high pyridinic N content is expected to have superior performance as an electrocatalyst in ORR. The O 1s region in the XPS spectra indicates that a limited amount of atmospheric O2 or CO2 is absorbed by the composite along with the abovementioned functional groups containing oxygen attached to the CN/NCNT composite. (30) The FTIR spectra of the CN/NCNT composite give more details about the functional groups on its surface (Figure S1). Bands associated with carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups were observed, confirming that oxygen groups of various types are present in the CN/NCNT composite. The oxygen content of CN electrodes has been reported to have a positive influence on oxygen adsorption; hence, the high oxygen content in the current composite will likely contribute to the electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR. The C 1s region, shown in Figure 4e, indicates different carbon bonding environments in the synthesized CN/NCNT composite. (28,31) The C 1s region in the XPS spectra of CN is shown in Figure S2, which exhibited the differences in C groups in the CN/NCNT composite and CN.\nElectrochemical Tests\nThe electrochemical activity was studied by CV measurements on a GC rotation-disk electrode (RDE), as illustrated in Figure 5. Herein, Figure 5a,b show the CV curves of the CN/NCNT composite. In the KOH saturated with Ar, featureless currents appear between −0.7 and −0.3 V, indicating that no obvious reduction reaction occurred in the system. Conversely, as the KOH solution was saturated with O2, a clear cathodic peak appeared at −0.51 V, which confirmed the electrocatalytic activity of the CN/NCNT composite in the ORR. However, the CV curve of the pristine CN material showed a negligible ORR peak (Figure 5c), even when KOH was saturated with O2, which indicated a weak electrocatalytic ORR performance. This result might be attributed to the poor conductivity of CN, which limits the electron transfer in the electrocatalytic process. (9) The performance of the Pt/C electrode was also compared with that of the synthesized electrode. The CV curve of the NCNT material is exhibited in Figure S3 and demonstrated that the NCNT material used in this study possessed good electrochemical activity for ORR.

(9) The performance of the Pt/C electrode was also compared with that of the synthesized electrode. The CV curve of the NCNT material is exhibited in Figure S3 and demonstrated that the NCNT material used in this study possessed good electrochemical activity for ORR. The Pt/C electrocatalyst had relatively good performance in catalyzing the ORR with a cathodic potential at −0.19 V, shifting positively compared with −0.51 V of the CN/NCNT composite (Figure 5d). This result indicates a more facile ORR at the classic Pt/C electrode.\nFigure 5\nFigure 5. CV curves of the CN/NCNT electrode in (a) O2-saturated and (b) Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH solutions; CV curves of (c) CN and (d) Pt/C in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH; scan rate, −20 mV/s; (e) Current–time chronoamperometric responses at −0.50 V in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution on CN/NCNT and Pt/C electrodes; (f) LSV curves of various materials at 1500 rpm.\nAlso, the current electrocatalyst might be affected by the crossover effects. (32) The electrocatalytic selectivity of the CN/NCNT electrode and that of Pt/C were measured during the electro-oxidation of methanol based on their corresponding current–time chronoamperometric responses under the same conditions. A noticeable decrease of the current signal occurred for Pt/C with methanol (2.0 M) (Figure 5e), which indicated that the Pt/C cathode was heavily poisoned by methanol. However, the as-synthesized CN/NCNT composite maintained a strong and stable amperometric response, and no notable changes were detected on injection of methanol, exhibiting superior resistance to the crossover effect, which is attributed to the lower oxygen reduction potential compared with that needed to oxidize the fuel molecules. (15)\nLSV measurements were conducted on a RDE with the as-synthesized composite. The onset potential of the CN/NCNT composite (−0.45 V) was slightly less negative than that of the pristine CN material (−0.60 V) but still much more negative than that of Pt/C (Figure 5f), indicating that the ORR on the CN/NCNT electrode is initiated later than that on the Pt/C material, which agrees with the CV curves. Nevertheless, the CN/NCNT composite had comparable electrocatalytic activity, and the limiting diffusion current density (−3.86 mA cm–2) at −1.40 V was approximately 4 times as high as that of CN material (−0.96 mA cm–2), suggesting that the electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated CN/NCNT was high. Notably, the CN/NCNT material has relatively negative onset potential but a high current density, which might be a good alternative to commercially available Pt/C, considering its metal-free nature and cost-effective synthesis.\nRDE voltammetry measurements were again conducted to provide LSV curves of the electrode fabricated from these materials at different rotation rates (625, 900, 1225, 1600, and 2025 rpm). The limiting current density is strongly associated with the rotation speed of the electrode, and the LSV curves were similar in shape (Figure 6a,b). Additionally, a typical kinetic current slope appeared between −0.48 and −1.10 V as well as a diffusion limiting current platform from −1.40 to −1.15 V. The limiting current density of both the CN/NCNT composite and CN increased gradually as the rotation rate was increased, which is primarily attributed to the gradually accelerating diffusion process at a higher rotation speed.\nFigure 6\nFigure 6.

This finding confirms the superior electrocatalytic performance of the current composite in terms of the ORR. The number of transferred electron numbers per O2 molecule related to the ORR can be calculated from the following Koutechy–Levich equation (K–L equation). This analysis confirmed that the overall current density (j) is attributed to the kinetic current density (jk) and the diffusion-limiting one. (32)\n(1)\nwhere jk in this equation denotes the kinetic current, ω refers to the electrode-rotating rate, and B is calculated from the K–L plots according to the following Levich equation\n(2)\nwhere n is the symbol for the electron-transfer number, F is the Faraday constant (96,485 C mol–1), DO2 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 (1.90 × 10–5 cm2 s–1), ν is the kinematic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm2 s–1), and CO2 represents the bulk concentration of O2 and was measured to be 1.2 × 10–3 mol L–1 in 0.1 M KOH solution. 0.2 here is used when the rotation rate is expressed in rpm.\nK–L plots at various electrode potentials represent the relationship of j–1 and ω–0.5 and exhibited both good linearity and parallelism (Figure 6c,d), which indicates the first-order reaction kinetics with O2. The electron-transfer number was derived from the slope value of K–L plots via eq 1. The slopes of the plots remained almost constant in the range of −1.15 to −1.35 V. Specifically, the as-prepared CN/NCNT composite shows its excellent activity of catalyzing the ORR with the highest electron transfer number of 3.97 at an electrode potential of −1.30 V, indicating that CN/NCNTs can induce a nearly four-electron transfer in ORR. This result shows that the electron transfer for CN/NCNTs was close to that of Pt/C (Figure S4). Nevertheless, the pristine CN material presented both selectivity and catalytic activity at a lower level with its highest electron-transfer number being only about 1.24 at −1.30 V, which suggests a weak two-electron transfer. Furthermore, the electron-transfer numbers for both the CN/NCNT composite and the pristine CN material were determined over a wide potential range (Figure 6e). The electron-transfer number of both the CN/NCNT and CN material varied as the electrode potential was changed, indicating a pronounced dependence between the potential and electron transfer in the ORR. Particularly, as the potential decreased, the electron-transfer numbers of the CN/NCNT composite increased. Furthermore, the electron-transfer numbers on the CN/NCNT electrode were higher than those on the CN electrode, which confirms the superior electrocatalytic activity of the CN/NCNT composite compared with that of pristine CN material. Additionally, the ORR at the CN/NCNT electrode, starting at approximately −1.15 V, generally proceeds via a four-electron pathway from −1.20 to −1.40 V, whereas the number of transferred electrons on CN remained below 1.50. Thus, CN/NCNTs was a more efficient electrocatalyst. The superior electron-transfer ability of the CN/NCNT composite is closely associated with its high electrical conductivity. Because pristine CN is a polymer with poor conductivity, electron transfer is limited, resulting in a low electron-transfer number. Because of introduction of the NCNT, the electrical conductivity of the composite was markedly enhanced, which thus promoted the electron-transfer number for the CN/NCNT composite. The above explanation is further confirmed by EIS (Figure S5). The overall electrochemical resistance of the CN/NCNT composite is noticeably lower than that of the CN material. The electrocatalytic activity for ORR is also reflected by the calculated kinetic current density (jk) (Figure 6f) of both electrodes because jk of CN/NCNTs (5.99–10.10 mA cm–2) is more than 8 times high than that of the CN material (1.63–1.97 mA cm–2). Hence, the CN/NCNT composite shows great promise to be a metal-free ORR electrocatalyst.\nRR",

Hence, the CN/NCNT composite shows great promise to be a metal-free ORR electrocatalyst.\nRRDE voltammetry was used to assess the formation of hydrogen peroxide ions (HO–2) (Figure 7). The current densities on the ring and disk were measured for the CN/NCNT composite and the pristine CN material, respectively, and compared with the results for the commercially available Pt/C electrode. The as-fabricated CN/NCNT composite had a higher disk current density and generated a small amount of HO–2, whereas the pristine CN material yielded a much greater amount of HO–2 (Figure 7a,b), suggesting that the CN/NCNT composite was a more efficient electrocatalyst than pristine CN. Moreover, the electron-transfer numbers for these electrodes were deduced from the disk/ring current according to the following equation (33)\n(3)\nwhere ID and IR refer to the Faradaic disk and ring currents, respectively. N is 0.31, as determined with a probe [Fe(CN)63–/4–]. Remarkably, the electron-transfer number for the CN/NCNT electrode was 3.91 at −1.20 V and that of the Pt/C electrode was 3.94 at −0.6 V (Figure 7c), confirming that the ORR of CN/NCNTs follows an almost complete four-electron pathway. However, pristine CN showed weakness in catalyzing the reduction process with its electron-transfer number calculated to be only 1.33. Hence, the electrocatalytic activity of CN was greatly improved due to NCNT impregnation.\nFigure 7\nFigure 7. RRDE voltammograms recorded with the CN/NCNT composite at 1000 rpm: (a) CN/NCNTs, (b) CN, and (c) Pt/C electrode.\nFinally, the stability of the CN/NCNT composite for ORR was assessed by a chronoamperometric method at −0.50 V at 1600 rpm (Figure S6). The electrocatalytic efficiency of the Pt/C electrode suffered noticeable losses over time. Nonetheless, the as-synthesized CN/NCNT composite had a much lower decrease compared with Pt/C and showed outstanding stability in an alkaline medium.\nConclusions\nA metal-free CN/NCNT electrocatalyst was fabricated by a simple and cost-effective method which shows potential for extension to practical production. The resulting composite featured a combination of characteristics, such as a clear uneven morphology, a high proportion of pyridinic nitrogen and some oxygen-containing groups, and superior conductivity. These are favorable properties that contributed to the outstanding electrocatalytic efficiency for ORR. This study confirmed that the as-synthesized CN/NCNT composite has an electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR comparable with that of currently available platinum electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the electrode features superior tolerance to crossover effects and excellent long-term stability. The synthesized composite not only provides an efficient ORR electrocatalyst with potential for industrial applications but also shows great promise for catalytic applications beyond alkaline FCs.\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsami.0c13656.\nFTIR spectra of CN/NCNT, CN, and NCNT materials; C 1s region in the XPS spectra of CN material; CV curves of the NCNT material; LSV curves and K–L plots on the Pt/C electrode; electrochemical impedance spectra of NCNT and CN materials; and current–time chronoamperometric response of NCNT/CN and Pt/C (PDF)\nam0c13656_si_001.pdf (342.27 kb)\nTerms & Conditions\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.
