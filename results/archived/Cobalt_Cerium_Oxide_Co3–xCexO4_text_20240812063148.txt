  "0": "1. Introduction\nA lot of efforts have been made to improve the efficiency of electrochemical energy conversion and storage. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an essential step in lithium-ion/metal-air batteries, supercapacitors, and photochemical water splitting. (1−4) OER is a complex four-electron transfer process that requires a large overpotential to surmount the energy barrier. Screening efficient catalysts to overcome sluggish kinetics and reduce the overpotential is needed. (5,6) Materials based on noble metal, and their hybrids, have long been considered as the most efficient catalysts for OER. (7,8) In an acid media, the most effective OER catalysts are ruthenium- and iridium-based oxides. However, the scarcity and high material cost hinder their large-scale application. (9−16) In an alkaline media, oxides and hydroxides of first-row transition metals were found to exhibit high activity. (17−21) For instance, spinel cobalt oxide (Co3O4) and the substituted cobaltites MxCo3–xO4 (M = Fe, Ni, Cu or Ce, etc.) show decent activity and may replace precious catalysts. (22−25) More importantly, the cobalt (oxy)hydroxides were proven to be the active phase of the Co-based catalyst through both theoretical calculations (26) and experimental results. (27,28) Moreover, Zhang et al. (29) reported gelled FeCoW oxyhydroxides with atomically homogeneous metal distribution via a room-temperature sol–gel procedure, where the adsorption of intermediate OH* can be adjusted by constructing a suitable transition-metal composition. However, new insights into the formation of cobalt (oxy)hydroxides and/or transition-metal (oxy)hydroxides during oxygen evolution process are needed to advance the development of OER catalysts and water oxidation systems.\nThere are well-known strategies to enhance catalytic activity. These include alloying to modify the electronic structure, (9) nanostructuring to enlarge specific area, (30) and constructing a composite to combine respective advantages. (6) Amorphous structures with uniformly distributed defectives, such as vacancies, abnormal oxidation state ions, special coordination ions, or metal ion pairs, have all been used for electrocatalyst design. (27,31−33) It is also known that the amorphous phase with a large proportion of unsaturated bonds can facilitate the adsorption of intermediate reactants. (34) For example, as an amorphous OER electrocatalyst, cobalt–phosphate catalyst was demonstrated to be catalytically active in a neutral electrolyte and showed self-repair capacity. (32,35) Recently, Han et al. fabricated high-density crystalline–amorphous (c-a) interfaces by selectively fluorination doping; these c-a boundaries can act as catalytic sites to boost the OER. (36) In previously reported works, however, structural amorphization treatment often involves complicated processing. Typically, dangerous gas (H2 and NH3) treatment at high temperatures (37) or high-energy ion implantation (38) is needed. Although the defective amorphous phase brings a large number of active sites, the rich dangling bond leads to intrinsically low conductivity. This explains why pure amorphous phase shows lower catalytic properties compared with their crystalline counterpart. (39) Therefore, an effective OER catalyst should be designed and synthesized carefully to make a compromise between the activity and conductivity.\nIn general, cerium-doped cobalt oxide or its composite is considered to be an excellent catalyst. (40−43) For instance, Savereide et al. (40) developed a two-step electrodeposition process to obtain a CeOx/CoOx structure for reduction of NO by CO. Xu et al. (43) proposed an electrostatic spray deposition method to prepare an amorphous thin film of CoOx(Ce), which shows comparative OER catalytic performance compared with commercial noble metal electrocatalyst (RuO2). For quite some time, studies seldom explored the effects of doped Ce on the microstructure. (44) More importantly, methods for the formation of amorphous material or tailoring the crystallinity is not amenable to crystal phase, and modulating the amorphous phase in cerium-doped cobalt oxide remains highly challenging. According to the previous analysis, (45,46) cerium oxide has a good oxygen storage capacity and can be incorporated as an excellent component to enhance OER activity.

According to the previous analysis, (45,46) cerium oxide has a good oxygen storage capacity and can be incorporated as an excellent component to enhance OER activity. Also, the cerium oxides can inhibit the corrosion of metal oxides and regulate the diffusion of redox species. (47) The key drawback, however, is large proportion of ceria composition may lead to serious interface resistance and active sites blocking (poisoning). More recently, Chai et al. (41) combined catalytically inactive CeO2 with spinel structure Co3O4 by a built-in p–n heterojunction, and the interface with the optimal ratio of Ce/Co exhibits high OER activity. Additionally, Mullins’s group discovered that CeOx deposited on the CoOx catalyst leads to highly active OER electrocatalysts via a synergistic effect between Co and Ce. (44) Nevertheless, little is known about the crystallinity and electronic effect for OER for cerium oxide-modified cobalt oxides. Moreover, in terms of activity and durability in operating conditions, it is far from an ideal catalyst with improved methods.\nIn this study, cerium-modified cobalt oxides with disordered structure were found to have enhanced OER performance. The electrocatalysts can be fabricated by introducing cerium into Co3O4 (Co3–xCexO4) via a facile electrodeposition method. The nickel-foam-supported Co3–xCexO4 electrode shows excellent activity (η = 307 mV at 100 mA cm–2) and durability (100 h without obvious decay) for OER. From a series of microscopic and in situ spectroscopic characterization, we uncover, investigate, and discuss the structural variation and electronic transport phase transformation during OER process after cerium modification. The enhanced catalytic activity can be ascribed to the higher disorder degree of structure for Ce-doped sample (Co3–xCexO4) which enables the phase transformation at lower oxidation bias. Compared to the layered composite sample (Co3O4–CeO2), the disorder structure of Co3–xCexO4 facilitates the electronic transport between Co and Ce and accelerates the formation of intermediates which accounts for enhanced OER activity.\n2. Results and Discussion\n2.1. Chemical Composition and Structure of Ce-Doped Co3O4 (Co3–xCexO4)\nTypically, the cerium-modified cobalt oxide was prepared by applying a constant potential of −1 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in solution containing 20 mM total metal ions (see details in the Experimental Section in the Supporting Information). The phase of electrodeposited samples was clarified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Figure S1a). For electrode nickel foam/Co3O4 (NF/Co3O4), all peaks are indexed to the standard XRD pattern of spinel Co3O4 (PDF no. 43-1003) except for diffraction peaks from NF. To confirm the accurate chemical composition of Co3–xCexO4, we used inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis to confirm the atomic ratio of the elements. The Co/Ce molar ratio in Co3–xCexO4 is 13:1, which slightly differs from molar ratio (Co/Ce = 20:1) of the deposition solution. This is closely related to the capacity of hydroxyl ions to precipitate metal ions. (48) Diffraction peaks of electrode nickel foam/Co3–xCexO4 (NF/Co3–xCexO4) become much weaker and wider, which indicates the decreased crystallinity and grain refining after cerium modification. Meanwhile, no ceria-related peak was observed due to small quantity or amorphous state. The surface composition and valence state were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Typical spectra of all samples display signals of Ce 3d, Co 2p, and O 1s as presented in Figure S1b. Only a weak signal of Ce 3d can be detected on the surface of Co3–xCexO4. Nickel foam/cerium oxide (NF/CeO2) was also prepared for convenient comparison, and the binding energy of Ce 3d in CeO2 is consistent to that of Co3–xCexO4. For those accurate superficial characteristics of Co3–xCexO4,",

Nickel foam/cerium oxide (NF/CeO2) was also prepared for convenient comparison, and the binding energy of Ce 3d in CeO2 is consistent to that of Co3–xCexO4. For those accurate superficial characteristics of Co3–xCexO4, further component and valence state are needed.\nAs shown in Figure S1c, the high-resolution Co 2p spectrum of Co3–xCexO4 can be deconvoluted to Co2+ and Co3+ species; peaks with binding energies of 796.5 and 781.1 eV are assigned to Co2+, while peaks at 795.1 and 779.7 eV belong to Co3+. By comparison with Co3O4, there is a negative shift of 0.3 eV for Co3+ in Co3–xCexO4, indicating the existence of electron transfer between Ce and Co (Figure S1c). The six peaks in Figure S1d from the electrodeposited ceria electrode are characteristic of Ce. All Ce 3d peaks from Co3–xCexO4 shift to a high binding energy by 0.4 eV, which indicates strong electron transfer from Ce to Co because of the lower electron affinity of Ce. This can be explained by the electronegativity difference between cerium and cobalt, where the electronegativity of Ce is relatively smaller than that of Co. (49) Therefore, the electronic interaction of cerium and cobalt will effectively regulate the electron densities of Co3–xCexO4 surface, further influencing its electrocatalytic properties. The electronic structure modification of Co3–xCexO4 surface will be discussed later.\nNext, we proceeded to analyze the morphological and structural properties of Co3–xCexO4. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Figure 1a) clearly illustrate the electrodeposited catalyst Co3O4 composed of well-defined nanosheets with wrinkled surfaces. The high-magnification SEM images (Figure 1b) reveal that the thickness of a Co3O4 nanosheet with wrinkled surface is approximately 10 nm. For a Ce-doped sample, the scale of nanosheets decreases significantly and shows a densely wrinkled surface (Figure 1d). Figure 1e shows that the Ce dopant makes the nanosheets of Co3–xCexO4 more fragmented and thinner. We also use atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure the thickness of the nanosheet from two samples. Ce brings a critical effect on the morphology and size of the electrodeposited Co3O4. The thickness of the Co3O4 nanosheet is ca. 11 nm (Figure 1c), and the Co3–xCexO4 nanosheet is formed by 5-steps, ca. 45 nm-thick plates (Figure 1f). These smaller sheets assemble to a Co3–xCexO4 layer, which leads to a larger surface area. The nanosheets layer with a porous structure favors the permeation of electrolyte ions into inner cobalt species during the OER reaction. (24,30)\nFigure 1\nFigure 1.

SAED of (i) Co3O4 and (l) Co3–xCexO4 nanosheets.\nTo further reveal the morphological structure and properties, pure Co3O4 and Ce-doped samples were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). TEM images (Figure 1g and h) of Co3O4 reveal that the nanosheets consist of overlapped nanocrystallines, and well-defined lattice fringes are observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, with a lattice spacing of 0.47 nm corresponding to the Co3O4 (111) facet. The structural evolution was also demonstrated by the selective area electron diffractive (SAED) technique. In Figure 1i, the distributed spot-diffraction pattern demonstrated that the deposited Co3O4 nanocrystalline adopts almost a single-crystalline nature. By contrast, the microstructure of Co3–xCexO4 becomes more disordered obviously after Ce doping as shown in Figure 1j and k. More information on HRTEM and HADDF-TEM is provided in Figure S2. The broad-ring pattern in Figure 1l confirms the highly disordered structure of Co3–xCexO4 sample. From the HRTEM image of the Co3–xCexO4 sample (Ce/Co = 5%), the scattered nanocrystallines in amorphous matrix lead to a mosaic structure. Also, the variations of the crystallinity for these samples Co3–xCexO4 (Ce/Co = 2%, 5%, and 8% in electrodeposition aqueous solution) were investigated as shown in Figure S3, where the degree of structural disorder increases with the increasing Ce content as revealed by the continued evolution from discrete diffraction spots to the diffused diffracted ring in the SAED.\n2.2. Electrochemical Property of Co3–xCexO4\nAs described, the addition of Ce results in the disordered structure for Co3O4, which therefore affects the structure–property relationship of Co3–xCexO4. To understand the variation of structures and evaluate the electrochemical property of the catalysts, the electrocatalytic performance of the above anodic electrodes was investigated in 1 M KOH solution. The NF-supported catalysts can be utilized as working electrodes without extra substrate or additional binders. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves (Figure 2a) show clear redox current peaks prior to oxygen evolution, which is related to the conversion of low state of metal (Co2+/Co3+) to higher oxidation state species. (30) As Figure 2a and Figure S4 (LSV test performed on glass carbon) indicated, NF/Co3–xCexO4 shows much better OER activity than that of NF/Co3O4. Specifically, the anode OER current density reaches 100 mA cm2 at 1.537 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, all potentials are normalized to RHE in this context, unless otherwise stated) (η = 307 mV) for NF/Co3–xCexO. However, the pure NF/Co3O4 anode requires 1.594 V (η = 364 mV) to generate a polarization current of 100 mA cm–2. The effect of Ce-dopant concentration on the electrocatalytic performance was investigated, and the electrode with the best OER activity was electrodeposited from the aqueous solution with 5% Ce3+ ions. (Figure 2b). The increased disorder degree of multiporous endows NF/Co3–xCexO4 with improved performance in electrocatalytic reactions. However, conductivity often decreased seriously due to the overwhelming amount of dangling bonds. The moderate disorder can not only induce more defect and active sites but also accelerate charge transport to active sites. Then, the corresponding Tafel slopes of the LSV curves shown in Figure 2c were used to evaluate the reaction kinetics of the electrocatalysts. Compared with NF/Co3O4 sample, a smaller slope of 48 mV dec–1 was achieved for NF/Co3–xCexO4 sample. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of electrodes was used to evaluate the capacity of charge transfer for samples with varying structures. The charge transfers resistance (Rct) can be obtained from the Nyquist plots (Figure 2d), and the Rct value of NF/Co3–xCexO4 is estimated to be about 3 Ω according to the diameter of the semicircle at low-frequency region, which is much smaller than that (",

The charge transfers resistance (Rct) can be obtained from the Nyquist plots (Figure 2d), and the Rct value of NF/Co3–xCexO4 is estimated to be about 3 Ω according to the diameter of the semicircle at low-frequency region, which is much smaller than that (ca. 8 Ω) of NF/Co3O4; this suggests that the charge transfer rate in NF/Co3–xCexO4 is relatively faster compared with NF/Co3O4 during OER. It is noted that structural disorder affects the morphology of cobalt oxide and also dramatically mutates the electrochemical properties.\nFigure 2\nFigure 2. (a) LSV curves of Co3O4 and Co3–xCexO4 in O2 saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 (with iR compensation). (b) LSV curves of Co3–xCexO4 with different amounts of Ce (with iR compensation). (c) Tafel plot of Co3O4 and Co3–xCexO4. (d) Nyquist plots of the Co3O4 and Co3–xCexO4 in O2-saturated 1 M KOH electrolyte at an overpotential of 370 mV. (e) Current–time curve of Co3–xCexO4 recorded in a potentiostatic electrolysis experiment. Inset of (e) shows the LSV curves measured before and after a potentiostatic electrolysis experiment. (f) Comparison of theoretical and detected volume of oxygen generated from a potentiostatic electrolysis.\nThe polarization curves at different temperatures under atmospheric pressure for NF/Co3O4 and NF/Co3–xCexO4 were recorded (Figure S5a, b). The apparent activation energy (Ea) for OER is calculated by the Arrhenius plots of the log of current density (j0) versus the inverse of temperature (Figure S5c). The Ea of NF/Co3–xCexO4 is about 44.4 kJ mol–1 and is smaller than that of NF/Co3O4 (50.6 kJ mol–1). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) is a normal criterion for evaluating the intrinsic activity of OER catalysts. We use the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) to estimate the catalytic surface area (Figure S6). (50) As expected, NF/Co3–xCexO4 has a larger ECSA (1.74 cm2) than that of NF/Co3O4 (1.24 cm2). Then, the higher intrinsic activity for Co3–xCexO4 was illustrated by the ECSA corrected LSV in Figure S7. The Cdl and ECSA of Co3–xCexO4 lie in the interplay between intrinsic catalytic activity of catalytic sites and charge transport properties. Due to the formation of amorphous region of Co3–xCexO4, more defects and active sites are exposed at surfaces, where the charge transfer enhanced by Ce species. Defects created in the interface of crystalline and amorphous region, as well as the charge transfer enhancement of Ce, contribute to the improved OER performance. In addition, a stable current density of NF/Co3–xCexO4 was recorded in the current–time (i-t) curve over 100 h (Figure 2e), directly verifying the superior catalytic stability in the alkaline electrolyte. Meanwhile, no discernible change was found from the LSV curve recorded after the stability test (inset of Figure 2e). On the other hand, the electron conversion efficiency of electrochemical reaction is necessary to be quantified, and hydrogen (oxygen) production of the ideal catalyst obeys Faraday’s Law. The actual amount of gas evolved under a certain OER bias is a more reliable evidence, because the change of oxidation state of certain elements will result in misleading current. Experimentally, a total amount of evolved oxygen was measured by a drainage method (51) with a current of 60 mA, and the faraday efficiency (FE) for the NF/Co3–xCexO4 electrode was calculated as 98.4% with an overpotential of 295 mV. In the same procedure, the FE of NF/Co3O4 is 93.7% (Figure 2f). The higher OER faraday efficiency of NF/Co3–xCexO",

In the same procedure, the FE of NF/Co3O4 is 93.7% (Figure 2f). The higher OER faraday efficiency of NF/Co3–xCexO4 electrode compared with the NF/Co3O4 electrode further demonstrates the optimization effect of cerium. The turnover frequency (TOF) quantifies the amount of O2 molecules evolved per active site per second at a certain overpotential, which is considered as a more scientific metric to assess the intrinsic activity of an electrocatalyst. (52) The TOF of Co3–xCexO4 and Co3O4 was calculated as 0.069 and 0.046 s–1, respectively, and the details are described in the Experimental Section.\n2.3. In Situ Spectroscopy Analysis of Co3O4 and Co3–xCexO4\nCombining the structural characterization and electrochemical results, the structural disorder plays a role in boosting the intrinsic OER activity. The presence of Ce apparently facilitates the oxidation of Co at lower potentials for the Co3–xCexO4 sample. However, the kinetics of the OER process and products are not well demonstrated in LSV testing. Therefore, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) was used to investigate volatile reaction products. (17,18)Figure 3a and b shows the cyclic voltammetric scan versus the mass spectrometry results for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution of samples Co3O4 and Co3–xCexO4, respectively. The blue profile is converted from the cyclic voltammetric (CV) curve with time, and the area under the CV curve (blue area) represents the total anodic charge. The red area converted from the mass spectrometric trace represents the charge consumed for O2 formation. We note that for sample Co3–xCexO4, the O2 signal was detected at lower potential (1.42 V) compared with that of pure Co3O4 (1.48 V). Moved to FE analysis for the O2 evolution process, experimentally, the FE can be evaluated by mass charge versus input charge (eq 1).\n(1)\nThe faradic current (denoted as Qca, Qca = ica × t) was recorded through chronoamperometry testing. Meanwhile, we collected the corresponding online mass spectrometric ion current (denoted as Qms = ims × t). Then, the coefficient K as the slope of mass current versus input current (ims = ica × K) was calculated. The FE for Co3–xCexO4 is 95.09%, which is higher than that of Co3O4 (90.55%) over the test potential range.\nFigure 3\nFigure 3. In situ cyclic voltammetric scan (blue curve) and the corresponding faradaic ion current of O2 (m/z = 32) (pink curve) of (a) Co3O4 and (b) Co3–xCexO4. In situ Raman spectra of (c) Co3O4 and (d) Co3–xCexO4 at different potentials from open circuit potentials (OCP) to 1.6 V in 1 M KOH solution.\nThe activity and stability of OER catalyst closely depend on structural evolution during the reaction. The surface structural information on Co3O4 and Co3–xCexO4 varying with increasing potential was recorded by in situ Raman spectra in 1 M KOH (Figure 3c and d). Raman technique can probe any active molecular vibration by relying on inelastically scattered light. All Raman spectra were acquired during chronopotentiometry (CP) test at a certain bias. For both Co3O4 and Co3–xCexO4, peaks observed at 193, 483, 526, and 694 cm–1 at open circuit voltage (OCP) are assigned to active Raman vibrational modes (Fg2, Eg, Fg2, and Ag1) of spinel Co3O4. (53,54) Co2+ and Co3+ occupy the tetrahedral and octahedral lattice site in typical spinel structure. This initial characterization reveals that both samples adopt the spinel structure nature regardless of doping. Both Co2+ and Co3+ ions contribute to the Raman vibrations of Eg and Fg2, while the",

This initial characterization reveals that both samples adopt the spinel structure nature regardless of doping. Both Co2+ and Co3+ ions contribute to the Raman vibrations of Eg and Fg2, while the Ag1 is only caused by the octahedral Co3+ ions. A small peak at 193 cm–1 disappears after a small bias increment. Similarly, the peak at 694 cm–1 decreases with increasing bias and fades away at 1.6 and 1.5 V for Co3O4 and Co3–xCexO4, respectively. This Ag1 Raman peak is related to the Co–O vibration in CoO6 octahedra; therefore, the significant reduction of Ag1 intensity may be ascribed to the distortion of CoO6 octahedra. Additionally, a preoxidation stage may also lead to local structural rearrangement and the formation of OER active phase on the surface, which inhibits the detection of other signals. As raised to the potential at which OER occurs, the new feature that appears at 587 cm–1 can be ascribed to phase CoOOH. (55) These observations indicate that cobalt on the surface is gradually oxidized into CoOOH under a continuous oxidation process, which is the active phase for OER.\nCompared with pure Co3O4, the attenuation and emergence of peaks occur at a lower bias for the Ce-doped sample. These observations demonstrate that the structural distortion and transformation, which is parallel with OER, were facilitated by the introduction of Ce under oxidation potential. Combined with the TEM and SAED analysis, the introduction of Ce leads to a partially disorder structure (Figure 1). Compared with crystalline structure, the amorphous phase has a greater proportion of randomly-oriented bonds with unsaturated electronic configurations. In situ spectroscopic studies thus provide evidence that the prior formed intermediate is the CoOOH phase. As the Tafel slope of Co3–xCexO4 is 48 mV dec–1 (Figure 2c), the rate-determining step (RDS) of OER is step 2, i.e., M–O + OH– → M–OOH + e–. (56,57) Therefore, the formation of CoOOH is the limiting step for OER. Also, combined with DEMS, we uncover that Co3–xCexO4 has faster kinetics than Co3O4.\n2.4. Structural Distortion and Electronic Transport\nAs mentioned above, there is still no discrimination of the contribution of dopant itself or structural disorder. This remains an experimentally unexplored area. Numerous studies have shown that surface oxygen vacancies are important active species for the catalytic performance for CeO2. (58) The formation energy of oxygen vacancies on CeO2 is relatively low; therefore, oxygen atoms on the surface or in the bulk lattice can directly participate in OER reaction by forming oxygen vacancies. (59) According to theoretical arithmetic, 1/4 oxygen can be released at most in each CeO2 unit cell. (60) We further investigated whether the excellent performance of Co3–xCexO4 originates from reversible oxygen exchange capacity of cerium (lattice oxygen consumption and oxygen vacancy formation) or exclusively benefits from structural distortion (defect and active sites). Considering that amorphous Co3O4 is not easy to prepare with an electrodeposition method, for comparative analysis, we prepared a layered composite sample (NF/Co3O4–CeO2) which remains as an ordered structure. The proportion of Ce in NF/Co3O4–CeO2 (Co/Ce = 12:1) is confirmed by ICP-MS and is similar to that of NF/Co3–xCexO4. The NF/Co3O4–CeO2 electrode was updated from the NF/Co3O4 sample, including a layer of deposited Co3O4 nanosheets and another deposited thin CeO2 layer (see details in the Experimental Section). As shown in Figure S8a and b, the true form of cobalt oxide in this composite structure is covered by a layer of porous CeO2. TEM analysis was applied to uncover the microstructure of the Co3O4–CeO2 sample (Figure 4a and b), which can be clearly labeled by different lattice spaces in the HRTEM image that refer to (111) facets (0.467 nm) of Co3O4",

TEM analysis was applied to uncover the microstructure of the Co3O4–CeO2 sample (Figure 4a and b), which can be clearly labeled by different lattice spaces in the HRTEM image that refer to (111) facets (0.467 nm) of Co3O4 and (004) facets (0.259 nm) of CeO2. Two groups of diffraction spots were identified from the SAED pattern; specifically, discrete diffraction spots can be classified to Co3O4 and other spots which almost form diffraction rings belong to CeO2 (Figure 4c). The LSV curves of NF/Co3–xCexO4 and NF/Co3O4–CeO2 were put together for comparison of electrocatalytic activity (Figure S9a), where the NF/Co3–xCexO4 has much higher current density than that of NF/Co3O4–CeO2 under the same potential. Also, the EIS test indicates the NF/Co3O4–CeO2 has a larger resistance than that of NF/Co3–xCexO4 (Figure S9b). It is noted that NF/Co3–xCexO4 and NF/Co3O4–CeO2 have the same composition but different OER property; therefore, the disordered structure of catalyst plays a key role in mass transport during the OER process. For the doping sample, the crystalline–amorphous boundary with abundant defects can serve as additional active sites and boost the water oxidation reaction. (36) As for layered composite, depositing CeO2 on the porous Co3O4 surface decreases the structural order of the interface and diminishes the formation probability of active phase. To evaluate the active phase distribution, elemental mapping was employed to show the elemental distribution. The most distributed elements in areas 1 and 2 are Co and Ce, respectively (Figure 4d), which shows the obvious phase segregation of the Co3O4–CeO2 composite. Moreover, the Ce and Co elements of Co3–xCexO4 distributed uniformly (Figure 4e). Based on the above discussion, the structural order of Co3–xCexO4 was finely turned by the way of cerium doping. The sample disorder influences the distribution of active species and further impacts the adsorption/desorption of intermediate reactants as well as electron transport.\nFigure 4\nFigure 4. (a) Low-magnification and (b) HRTEM-TEM image of as-prepared Co3O4–CeO2. (c) SAED of Co3O4–CeO2 nanosheets. (d) Dark-filled TEM image and selected area element mapping of Co3O4–CeO2, showing obvious segregation for phases of Co3O4 and CeO2. (e) TEM image and mapping of the composting elements Co, Ce, and O of Co3–xCexO4.\nTo uncover the effect of the surface electronic structure on OER kinetics, we compared two samples with regard to their electron transport difference. From the XPS spectra of the as-prepared samples, we found that Co2+ and Co3+ coexist in both samples, and the Co2+/Co3+ molar ratio is relatively higher in Co3–xCexO4 (Figure 5a). The Co2+ species can be easily oxidized and transformed to CoOOH under peroxidation potential, (44,46) which is considered as an active species for OER. To evaluate the influence of the Co oxidation state, a deep-insight XPS analysis was conducted. First, samples were polarized in electrolyte solution under different OER potentials, frozen by liquid nitrogen, and transferred to XPS characterization (note: liquid nitrogen is dangerous, please use special gloves). The Co2+/Co3+ does not change too much after polarization at 1.8 V for 1 h for Co3–xCexO4 (Figure 5b–b″), contrasting with the downward trend shown by Co3O4–CeO2 (Figure 5c–c″). That means Co3–xCexO4 owns more stable active sites on the surface for OER. However, the ratio of Co2+ proportion for both samples increases slightly after a period of stable water oxidation process (polarized at 1.5 V) (Figure 5d).

This also confirms the newly appeared Raman signal when Co3–xCexO4 polarizes in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The high-resolution of Ce 3d XPS spectra of NF/Co3–xCexO4 and NF/Co3O4–CeO2 are also conducted and deconvoluted into Ce3+ and Ce4+ components (Figure S10), which confirms the capacity of oxygen exchange of cerium. (61,62) Meanwhile, the direct viewing of the molar percentage of Ce4+ and Co2+ is depicted in Figure 5e, which shows that NF/Co3–xCexO4 has a larger portion of Ce3+ and Co2+. Redox transformation of Ce4+/Ce3+ in NF/Co3–xCexO4 and NF/Co3O4–CeO2 is realized through the formation of O vacancy. (46) Specifically, a higher ratio of Ce3+ was formed in Co3–xCexO4, indicating a greater amount of oxygen vacancy formed. The redox transformation between Ce3+ and Ce4+ can activate lattice oxygen, thereby promoting the participating of lattice oxygen in OER. (63) On the other hand, the moderate amount of incorporated Ce3+ can help to tune binding energy of reactive intermediates by the reforming oxidation state of metal and electronic coupling effect. (64) It has been proposed that strengthening Co–O covalency due to the facilitated electron transfer between Co and O is a possible reaction mechanism for OER. (65) The 3d7 valence electronic configuration of Co2+ is in a high-spin state with unpaired electrons in the t2g-orbitals, which interacts with the bridging O2– via π-bonding. (66) Owing to the coupling between Ce3+ and Co2+, the π-bonding of Co–O can be strengthened by the electron delocalization and transfer of Ce3+, which triggers charge transfer from Ce3+ to Co2+, as suggested by our XPS result (Figure 5 and Figure S1). Generally, the cerium cation in CeO2 acts as the Lewis acidic site according to Lewis acid–base reactions, and electron-deficient CeO2 facilitates the reaction with metal–oxygen surface species, further accelerating the oxygen evolution electrocatalytic reaction. (41) The highly disordered phase of Co3–xCexO4 has rich Lewis acidic sites for OER activity.\nFigure 5\nFigure 5. (a) The high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra of Co3–xCexO4 and Co3O4–CeO2.

Conclusion\nIn summary, the cerium-doped Co3O4 nanosheet catalyst (Co3–xCexO4) exhibits higher intrinsic OER activity, better durability (over 100 h), and more favorable kinetics than the Co3O4 nanosheet. DEMS was also performed to demonstrate that the oxygen evolution is responsible for the rising current in LSV curve. The faradaic efficiency (both DEMS and drainage method) of O2 production of catalyst Co3–xCexO4 is higher than that for the Co3O4 sample. In situ Raman technology demonstrates that the Co3–xCexO4 catalyst offers active CoOOH for OER catalytic processes at lower overpotential. Based on XPS, we assume the synergistic effect between Co and Ce is significantly enhanced in the amorphous",

In situ Raman technology demonstrates that the Co3–xCexO4 catalyst offers active CoOOH for OER catalytic processes at lower overpotential. Based on XPS, we assume the synergistic effect between Co and Ce is significantly enhanced in the amorphous region in Co3–xCexO4 in comparison to layered Co3O4–CeO2 composite. Therefore, cerium modulates the amorphous degree of Co3O4 and further facilitates electronic transport which elucidates the efficient OER activity of Co3–xCexO4.\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsaem.0c00190.\nExperimental section; XRD analysis; XPS data; SEM and TEM images; and SAED patterns; ECAS results; and OER tests (PDF)\nae0c00190_si_001.pdf (1.04 MB)\nTerms & Conditions\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.
