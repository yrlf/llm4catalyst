Designing highly efficient, stable, and economic oxygen reaction electrocatalysts with atomically-dispersed metal–N–C active sites through an effective strategy is highly desired for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Currently, the preparation of monoatomic catalysts with high loading and high activity, and the assurance of active sites fully exposed and participating in the reaction is challenging. Herein, atomically-dispersed Fe sites anchored to a porous carbon (Fe-SA/PC) hybrid synthesized via a facile dual-confinement route is reported. The experimental and theoretical simulations reveal that edge oxygen dopants facilitate the micropore trapping of the organic iron complex and the formation of isolated Fe atoms by subsequent pyrolysis. The optimized Fe-SA/PC catalyst exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR with a half-wave potential of 0.91 V, which is superior to most of the reported single-atom catalysts. DFT calculations proved that Fe–Nx sites with carbon defects can synergistically reduce the reaction barriers as compared to the intact Fe–Nx atomic configuration. This work provides a promising strategy for the design and construction of a series of high performance single-atom catalysts.', 'Introduction': 'Carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),4 carbon black,30 reduced oxide graphene,31 and porous carbon structure32 have been introduced as substrates to support and disperse the metal–organic molecule to achieve the high density of M–N–C sites during the annealing process due to their high surface areas. For instance, Zhang et al. reported that the atomic dispersion of Fe on hierarchically structured porous carbon (SA–Fe–HPC) frameworks was achieved by pyrolysis of unsubstituted phthalocyanine/iron phthalocyanine complexes and hierarchically structured porous carbon. Benefiting from the protection of organic molecules and the large surface area of the carbon structure, a high concentration/exposure of Fe–N–C sites embedded in hierarchical porous carbon was achieved under the pyrolysis process. The catalyst exhibited high ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.89 V, as well as good stability in alkaline solution.32 Although significant progress has been made with M–N–C electrocatalysts, the facile synthesis and preparation of these catalysts with low cost should be taken into consideration for the development of metal single atom-based catalysts.\\nIn this paper, a facile and effective method is reported for the synthesis of atomically dispersed Fe anchored on a carbon matrix for the production of Fe–N4 species anchored to the carbon matrix after the pyrolysis process (denoted as Fe-SA/PC). Abundant pores and oxygen-containing functional groups on the porous carbon were significantly advantageous for reinforcing the dispersion of Fe(phen)3 (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) by combining the physically confined effects of micropores and the chemical bonding of oxygen dopant and π–π interactions, which were also investigated by computational simulations. The combination of the space-confined effect of micro/meso-pores on porous carbon and the protection of Fe ions by surrounding small molecules can efficiently inhibit the aggregation of iron and facilitate the formation of Fe–Nx species under high-temperature carbonization. The obtained two-dimensional carbon structures possess large surface area and continuous-rich transportation channels, which benefit the exposure of Fe–N4 active sites to facilitate the adsorption of intermediates and electron/mass transport. The strong interactions between the carbon substrate and single-atom Fe endow the catalyst with high efficiency. The optimized catalyst exhibited outstanding ORR activity, as well as high durability and methanol-tolerance in alkaline electrolyte, which is much better than that of the commercial Pt/C electrocatalyst. DFT calculations also revealed that the pore defects near Fe–Nx species can further modulate the electronic structure to optimize the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, resulting in excellent electrocatalytic activity. This rational preparation method using low-cost raw materials can be applied to many transition metal-single-atom nanomaterials in energy conversion applications.', 'Experimental section': 'Materials\\nSynthesis of porous carbon (PC)\\nSynthesis of Fe-SA/PC samples\\nCharacterization\\nElectrochemical measurements\\nElectron transfer numbers were calculated using the Koutecky–Levich equation.

Fig. 1f presents the N2 sorption isotherm and pore size distribution of the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 sample, indicating a hierarchical porous structure determined by the type I and IV isotherm characteristics.33 Fig. S3† shows the N2 sorption comparison of the prepared pristine porous carbon, Fe(phen)3/PC and the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 product. All samples present similar isotherm characteristics. The specific surface area and pore volume of pristine porous carbon were measured to be 1903 m2 g−1 and 1.23 cm3 g−1 (Table S1†). The pore size distribution curve also revealed well-developed micropores (<2 nm) and some small mesopores (∼2–4 nm) existing in the porous carbon. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra further revealed that plenty of O-species (6.06 at%) exist on the surface of the porous carbon (Fig. S4 and Table S2†). Considering the size and repulsion force between Fe complex molecules, it is likely that most pores can accommodate only one Fe(phen)3 molecule. Compared with the obtained porous carbon, the obvious decreases in the nitrogen uptake (P/P0 < 0.1) of the Fe(phen)3/PC and Fe-SA/PC–700–5 suggest that the adsorption of the organic complex effectively occurs in the micropores (Fig. S3a†).33 After the adsorption of the Fe(phen)3 complex on porous carbon, the obtained Fe(phen)3/PC composite had a specific surface area of 406.7 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.285 cm3 g−1. The distinct decreases in the surface area and pore volume caused by the occupation of the organic complex in the pores can further impede the aggregation of metal atoms during the pyrolysis process. The pore size distribution of Fe(phen)3/PC exhibited an obvious decrease as compared with that of the pristine PC in a broad range (0.5–4 nm) (Fig. S3b†). In particular, the micropores of about 0.8 nm disappeared due to the complete blockage as displayed in the pore size distribution curves, which is related to the size of the Fe(phen)3 molecule. The specific surface area and pore volume of Fe-SA/PC–700–5 are 606.9 m2 g−1 and 0.544 cm3 g−1, respectively, which are between those of PC and Fe(phen)3/PC. The increased surface area after calcination could be attributed to the decomposition of organic molecules and the release of pores during the pyrolysis treatment.33 Compared with the porous carbon, small micropores in Fe-SA/PC–700–5 completely disappeared due to the blocking of the Fe–Nx species. The remarkable degradation of the pore size distribution (2–4 nm) confirmed the successful formation of Fe–N–C coordination on the edge of mesopores.\\nExtended-tight-binding (xTB) modeling was used to further explore the adsorption mechanism of Fe(phen)3 on the porous carbon substrate. The possible formation types of Fe(phen)3 complex on the PC substrate are illustrated in Fig. S5 and S9.† Firstly, the optimized geometry of the 1,10-phenanthroline iron complex (Fe:phen = 1:3) and various carbon structures are shown in Fig. S5 and S6.† The results suggest that the small deviation with root mean square displacement (RMSD) is around 1.5 Å of the",
  "2": " the porous carbon substrate. The possible formation types of Fe(phen)3 complex on the PC substrate are illustrated in Fig. S5 and S9.† Firstly, the optimized geometry of the 1,10-phenanthroline iron complex (Fe:phen = 1:3) and various carbon structures are shown in Fig. S5 and S6.† The results suggest that the small deviation with root mean square displacement (RMSD) is around 1.5 Å of the xTB geometry, which is in good agreement with that recorded in the original xTB work showing the high accuracy of the GFN2-xTB method.34 Because of the large specific surface area, abundant meso/macro-pore structure, and high content of oxygen dopant of the as-prepared porous carbon, three kinds of carbon configuration patterns can be assumed: the initial structures of the pristine carbon sheet, and defect carbon with and without oxygen edges (Fig. S5†). The first three lowest energy xTB-optimized geometries for each combination of Fe(phen)3–pristine carbon/nanopore are displayed in Fig. S7–S9.† In the case of pristine carbon, the energy differences are so large that it makes the lowest energy structure the most probable one. The adsorbed conformation of the Fe(phen)3 complex in Fig. S7† for the lowest energy case exhibited the distortion of the lower two 1,10-phenanthroline branches. It is apparent from the results obtained that such distortion due to π–π interactions with the pristine carbon surface leads to a large energy difference as compared with the other two. In the case of the nanopores without oxygen edges, it was observed (Fig. S8†) that the energy differences between the first three structures were not so large, which can be explained by the similarity between the Fe(phen)3 complex with different locations of the nanopore. Interestingly, the Fe(phen)3 complexes are likely to be located around the regions with armchair edges. Moreover, no obvious structural distortions were found for the Fe(phen)3 complex. The van der Waals interaction between Fe(phen)3 complexes and carbon situated at the edge of the nanopores resulted in the micropore trapping strength to capture metal complexes. In the last case of a nanopore with oxygen edge shown in Fig. S9,† the oxygen atoms have strong interactions with the Fe(phen)3 complex owing to their much closer distance in the complex. The adsorption energies show a trend of Eads (nanopore with oxygen edge) > Eads (pristine carbon) > Eads (nanopore without oxygen edge). A much stronger adsorption strength of the Fe(phen)3 complex on the nanopore with oxygen edge can be explained by enhancing the polarization and coherent stabilization effects of neighboring oxygen edges.\\nHerein, BET analyses and theoretical results revealed that the formation of highly dispersed Fe single atoms can be attributed to a dual-confinement effect. Typically, the electrostatic interactions ensure the good pre-dispersion of Fe(phen)3. On the other hand, the steric effect further inhibits the aggregation of Fe during the pyrolysis process. The electrostatic interaction and steric effect work together for the formation of atomic Fe catalysts. From the calculations, it can be speculated that (1) the Fe(phen)3 complexes are more stably anchored to micropores across multi-layered graphitic carbon as compared to the single-layer, because more defect carbon atoms and oxygen atoms on the pore structure participate in the adsorption interaction. (2) The electronic trapping effect would be maximized when the pore size matches the small metal complex. The space confinement ensures the solo-trapping of the organic Fe complex, thereby leading to the growth of Fe single-atoms during pyrolysis treatment. The obtained single-atom catalyst with large surface area and abundant nanosized pores facilitates charge transfer and mass transport, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity.35\\nAs displayed in Fig. 1g and S10a,† the XRD patterns of the all samples exhibited two typical broad peaks at around 25° and 45°, corresponding to the (002) and (101) crystal phases of graphitic carbon, respectively.36 No other diffraction peaks were observed in the Fe-SA/PC–x–5 (x = 600, 700, and 800) samples under different pyrolysis temperatures, suggesting the absence of crystalline metal or metal compounds in the prepared catalysts. This result is in good agreement with the above–mentioned TEM analysis for the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 sample. Raman spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 1h and S10b.† The",

This result is in good agreement with the above–mentioned TEM analysis for the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 sample. Raman spectra of the samples are shown in Fig. 1h and S10b.† The peaks at around 1350 cm−1 and 1580 cm−1 are ascribed to the D band and G band of graphitic material.37 Fe-SA/PC–x–5 demonstrates a higher ID/IG ratio than that of porous carbon, indicating that the N-doping and the formation of Fe–Nx active sites can induce surface carbon atomic rearrangement and more defects under different pyrolysis temperatures.38 Moreover, the D band is higher than the G band, which implies the abundant defects in the carbon structure.39 The large amounts of defects in carbon matrix also play a significant role in enhancing the ORR catalytic activity due to the optimization of the electronic configuration.40\\nFig. 2 shows X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), Fourier-transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements of the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 product, determining its chemical state and coordination environment at the atomic level. Compared with the XANES curves of Fe foil and Fe2O3 samples, the absorption edge of the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst is located between those of the Fe and Fe2O3 samples and close to that of Fe2O3 (Fig. 2a). As the valence state of the element measured can be reflected by the absorption edge of the XANES, the average valence state of Fe species in Fe-SA/PC–700–5 should be situated between Fe2+ and Fe3+. EXAFS curves of the Fe foil, Fe2O3 and Fe-SA/PC–700–5 samples are described in Fig. 2b. For the curve of the Fe foil, the mean peak at 2.2 Å is attributed to the Fe–Fe bond. The Fe-SA/PC–700–5 sample exhibited only one main peak at around 1.50 Å, which can be ascribed to the Fe–N scattering path without obvious Fe–Fe peaks (2.2 Å).32 Furthermore, to gain the coordination configuration of Fe atom in the catalysts, EXAFS fittings in R and k spaces were carried out to investigate the structural parameters and evaluate the fitting quality as shown in Fig. 2c, S11–S13, and listed in Table S3.† The fitting results suggest that the Fe atom in the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 is surrounded by about 4 N atoms with and an average Fe–N bond length of 2.00 Å for the first shell. The proposed model of Fe–N4 is presented in Fig. 2c (inset).41,42\\nX-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were investigated to reveal the chemical composition and elemental valence of the catalysts as illustrated in Fig. S4, S14 and 2d–f.† The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Fe 2p3/2 in Fe-SA/PC–x–5 samples before acid etching can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 707.3, 709.4, 711.6 and 715.1 eV, assigned to the metallic Fe0, Fe2+ species, Fe3+ species and satellite peak, respectively (Fig. S14†).43–45 Compared with the sample at the pyrolysis temperature (@800 °C), the Fe 2p3/2 peak at 708.9 eV (@600 and @700 °C) have negative shifts, indicating the various electronic configurations and coordination environments of metal (Fe) in the different hybrids (Fig. S14a†).17 The survey PS spectra of the samples (Fig. S4a†) demonstrate that the nitrogen species in porous carbon, Fe-SA/PC–600–5, Fe-SA/PC–700–5 and Fe-SA/PC–800–5 were 0, 2.15, 3.48 and 1.82 at%, respectively (Table S2†).

To gain further insight into the chemical elements and coordination environment of the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst after etching, the C, O, N, and Fe contents in the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 hybrid were calculated to be 88.95, 7.19, 3.13, and 0.73 at%, respectively (Fig. S4b†). The high-resolution Fe 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 2d) showed the mean peak at around 711.0 eV in Fe-SA/PC–700–5, which can be ascribed to Fe 2p3/2 of the Fe–Nx species. As displayed in Fig. 2e, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of N 1s can be deconvoluted into four characteristic peaks. The peaks at 399.8, 401.1, and 402.9 eV were assigned to the binding energies of pyrrolic–N, graphitic–N, and N–oxide, respectively. The peak located at 398.5 eV could be attributed to the binding energies of pyridinic–N and Fe–N species.46–48 The formation of pyridinic–N and graphitic–N can also act as catalytic active sites for the ORR, which further benefits catalytic enhancement.29,43,48 The relative content of graphite nitrogen in Fe-SA/PC increased with the increase in the pyrolysis temperature (Fig. S14b†). The O 1s spectrum of the sample (Fig. 2f) exhibited the binding energies of 532.1, 531.6, and 533.2 eV, corresponding to the metal–OH, metal–O and C–O bonds, respectively.49 The O content in porous carbon was determined to be 7.19 at%, which contributed to the oxygen-containing functional groups on the carbon surface and the adsorption of H2O molecules on metal sites. The existing oxygen-containing moieties in the hybrid are beneficial for the chemical and physical adsorption of oxygen reaction intermediates, which can facilitate the ORR catalytic activity.49 According to the above analysis of TEM, XPS and EXAFS measurements, Fe atoms in the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 sample are atomically embedded in the N-doped porous carbon layers and coordinated with four N atoms. Fe and N atoms doped in the carbon matrix can modulate the electronic configuration of the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst and activate the reactants/intermediates, which can enhance the catalytic performance during the ORR process.40,41,50\\nElectrocatalytic performance\\nTo further demonstrate the electrocatalytic performance of the as-prepared catalysts for the ORR, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were also performed in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The catalytic activities of the Fe-SA/PC catalysts on adding different amounts of Fe source are displayed in Fig. 3b. The Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst showed outstanding catalytic performance with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91 V and diffusion-limited current density (Jd) of 5.4 mA cm−2 at −0.4 V (vs. RHE). Under the same conditions, low catalytic activities were achieved by the Fe-SA/PC–700–2 (E1/2 = 0.88 V and Jd = 5.4 mA cm−2) and Fe-SA/PC–700–10 catalysts (E1/2 = 0.8 V and Jd = 4.75 mA cm−2). This confirmed that the increased contents of Fe can enhance the ORR activity by increasing the density of single-atom active sites. However, large amounts of Fe may lead to the formation of excessive Fe-containing nanoparticles during the pyrolysis, thereby leading to the reduction of the density of Fe single-atoms.51 N-doped carbon showed a low half-wave potential of 0.75 V and current density of 3.78 mA cm−2 (−0.4 V vs. RHE). Compared to the N-doped porous carbon (NPC) catalyst, the higher ORR catalytic activities of the Fe-SA/PC catalysts with different amounts of Fe can be ascribed to the formation of Fe–Nx species in the carbon matrix, which are the significant",

Compared to the N-doped porous carbon (NPC) catalyst, the higher ORR catalytic activities of the Fe-SA/PC catalysts with different amounts of Fe can be ascribed to the formation of Fe–Nx species in the carbon matrix, which are the significant active sites for ORR performance (Table S4†). The actual atomic ratio of pristine NC and samples with a theoretical value of 5 wt% Fe calcined at different temperatures (600, 700 and 800 °C) are listed in Table S4.† The actual Fe weight from low-temperature (600 and 700 °C) synthesis was 3.2 wt% and 3.3 wt%, respectively, which are close to their theoretical values. The Fe-SA/PC–800–5 sample showed a higher actual weight ratio (6.6 wt%) than the theoretical value (5 wt%) from XPS analysis. This deviation can be attributed to the aggregation of Fe species to form nanoparticles on the surface of the substrate (Fig. S15a†). Since the XPS technique detects the surface character on the nanometer scale, the Fe particles in Fe-SA/PC–800–5 lead to a higher Fe content than in other samples. Moreover, Fe-SA/PC–700–2 and Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalysts also showed more positive half-wave potential as compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (E1/2 = 0.84 V) and many other non-precise catalysts summarized in Table S5.† The Fe-SA/PC–700–5 sample exhibited excellent ORR activity in O2-saturated 0.1 M H2SO4 solution with a half-wave potential of 0.72 V (vs. RHE) at a diffusion-limited current density of 5 mA cm−2 (Fig. S15b†). The Tafel slopes determined by the corresponding Tafel plots (Fig. 3c) were calculated to be 80, 77, 75, 68 and 66 mV dec−1, corresponding to the NPC, Fe-SA/PC–700–10, Pt/C, Fe-SA/PC–700–2, and Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalysts, respectively. The lowest Tafel slope of the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst indicates the fastest reaction kinetics toward the ORR. The superior activity of the catalyst could be attributed to the unique features of the as-prepared catalyst such as the high density of the well-dispersed Fe–Nx sites, highly conductive substrate, large specific surface area, and abundant nanopores in the carbon substrate. The pyrolysis temperature for the as-prepared precursor also influenced the ORR catalytic activity by regulating the coordination environment of metal–Nx, and the content of N species. Fig. S15c† shows the ORR performances of Fe-SA/PC samples under different pyrolysis temperatures in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. Compared with the catalytic activities of the Fe-SA/PC–600–5 catalyst (E1/2 = 0.77 V, Jd = 5.2 mA cm−2) and Fe-SA/PC–800–5 catalyst (E1/2 = 0.83 V, Jd = 6.1 mA cm−2), the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst obtained a higher ORR catalytic activity (E1/2 = 0.91 V and Jd = 5.4 mA cm−2). The Fe-SA/PC–800–5 catalyst exhibited a slightly higher Jd than that of the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst, which may be due to the formation of more graphitic–N species at higher pyrolysis temperature.52 The corresponding Tafel plots revealed that the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 possesses a low Tafel slope (66 mV dec−1) as compared with those of other catalysts such as Fe-SA/PC–600–5 (73 mV dec−1) and Fe-SA/PC–800–5 (69 mV dec−1) (Fig. S15d†). It is worth noting that the temperature of 700 °C is the candidate temperature for the balancing of the coordination environment and the dispersion of Fe atoms. The decreased ORR performance of Fe-SA/PC–800–5 can be ascribed to the aggregation of Fe as observed in HRT",

It is worth noting that the temperature of 700 °C is the candidate temperature for the balancing of the coordination environment and the dispersion of Fe atoms. The decreased ORR performance of Fe-SA/PC–800–5 can be ascribed to the aggregation of Fe as observed in HRTEM (Fig. S15a†).50 The ORR polarization curves were recorded at various rotation speeds using rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurement (Fig. 3d S16†). The corresponding Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots at different potentials were obtained to determine the electron transfer number (n) (Fig. 3e).53 The resulting average number of electrons transferred, calculated from the K–L plot, was 4 for Fe-SA/PC–700–5, which proves the 4-electron reduction process of the ORR. The excellent performance of the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst for the ORR is likely due to the optimal coordination environment, good conductivity, high amount of Fe–Nx species and large surface area, as well as the synergistic interaction between N-doped carbon and Fe–Nx species on the catalyst surface. These could eventually facilitate the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates and thereby improve the ORR performance of the optimized catalyst.\\nTo further investigate the electron transfer number (n) and the peroxide yield (H2O2%) of the synthesized samples, the RRDE measurements of the Fe-SA/PC–700–x recorded by the rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) are displayed in Fig. S17.† Based on the experimental results, in the potential range of 0.2–0.8 V (vs. RHE), the average electron transfer numbers were calculated to be 3.99 for Fe-SA/PC–700–2, 4.0 for Fe-SA/PC–700–5 and 3.7–3.96 for the Fe-SA/PC–700–10 sample (Fig. 3f). The corresponding H2O2 yield (%) was measured to be less than 1% for Fe-SA/PC–700–5 and the electron transfer number (n) was close to 4, which is consistent with the above-mentioned result from the K–L plots. These results also suggest a near four-electron ORR pathway due to the abundant Fe–N4 sites and optimized electronic structure in the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst.54–56\\nChronoamperometric (CA) curves were used to evaluate the catalytic durability and methanol-tolerance. The catalysts were assessed in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at 0.55 V (vs. RHE) as shown in Fig. 4a. After continuous testing for 33000 s, the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 sample exhibited high retention (94%) as compared with the initial current density, indicating excellent catalytic stability. Only 65% retention could be maintained for the commercial Pt/C after a continuous 20000 s. The electrochemical stability of the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 electrode was also evaluated by the CV cycle measurements. Compared with the initial polarization curve, the LSV curve had no obvious decay after the 3000th CV cycle between 0.6 and 1.1 V (vs. RHE) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 as shown in Fig. 4b, further indicating the remarkable stability. The methanol durability of the prepared Fe-SA/PC–700–5 and Pt/C samples was investigated by adding 5 v/v% methanol to 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with O2 at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm at 0.55 V (vs. RHE). As can be seen in Fig. 4c, the remarkable loss in the current density of the Pt/C catalyst was observed after injecting the methanol in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. In contrast, no obvious loss was observed in the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 electrode in the presence of methanol, suggesting the higher methanol-tolerance of Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst than that of the noble Pt/C catalyst. The Fe-SA/PC–700–5 electrode possessed a similar ORR activity before and after acid etching (Fig. 4d), suggesting a similar microstructure in both catalysts.

The Fe-SA/PC–700–5 electrode possessed a similar ORR activity before and after acid etching (Fig. 4d), suggesting a similar microstructure in both catalysts. These results reveal that the Fe-SA/PC–700–5 catalyst showed the best electrochemical performance owing to its abundant Fe–N4 species and the stability of Fe single-atoms without aggregation during the thermal treatment. The obtained high catalytic activity toward the ORR for the various metal catalysts can be attributed to the well-dispersed single atom Fe sites, large surface area and a highly conductive substrate. Moreover, our designed strategy has been successfully extended to construct other non-precious metals including Mn, Co, Cu and Zn. The achieved catalysts show high ORR performances: Mn-SA/PC (E(1/2) = 0.89 V, Jd = 5.35 mA cm−2), Co-SA/PC (E(1/2) = 0.87 V, Jd = 5.4 mA cm−2), Cu-SA/PC (E(1/2) = 0.85 V, Jd = 4.75 mA cm−2), and Zn-SA/PC (E(1/2) = 0.82 V, Jd = 4.25 mA cm−2) as illustrated in Fig. S18 and listed in Table S6.† This work can provide a general and convenient route for the construction of non-precious metals single-atom catalysts with low-cost and high-efficiency.\\nTheoretical calculations for electrocatalytic performance', 'Discussion': '', 'Conclusions': '', 'Conflicts of interest': '', 'Acknowledgements': 'D.
