Introduction\nDue to the rapid growth in global energy demand, fuel cells (FCs) and metal–air batteries (MABs) are favored because of their high energy densities and environmental-friendliness. (1−3) A typical FCs can convert the sustainable chemical energy to electric energy by oxidizing fuel (e.g., hydrogen, methanol) and reducing oxygen, in which the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key limiting step. (4) The MABs rely on the electrochemical redox reactions between the air cathode and metal anode to realize energy storage and conversion. The ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two critical reactions for MABs. (5,6) Both ORR and OER are dynamic slow processes involving multi-electron and multi-step elementary reactions. (7) Thus, it would be foremost to develop catalysts that can efficiently catalyze both ORR and OER on the cathode. As the oxygen electrocatalytic reactions are surface processes, the ideal oxygen electrode must possess good conductivity, high specific surface area, and well-dispersed catalysts.\nAt present, nanocarbon materials have been widely used as catalyst supports for oxygen electrocatalytic reactions due to their low density, high specific surface area and diverse structure. (8,9) Noble metal or metal oxide (e.g., Pt, IrO2) supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon are the most widely used catalysts. (10) However, these poorly graphitized carbon supports show unsatisfied conductivity to transmit electrons and tend to undergo electrochemical surface oxidation under extreme pH environment and high potential conditions on cathode of FCs and MABs. (11,12) This carbon corrosion process not only reduces the conductivity of the substrate, but also causes the structural fragmentation of the carbon skeleton, accelerating the catalysts aggregation or detachment from the substrate. (13) A suitable carbon support for oxygen electrocatalytic reactions should possess the following properties: large exposed surface area, good electrical conductivity, proper hydrophilicity, and high chemical stability. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) perfectly meet these requirements, making them ideal candidates for electrode materials. After years of development, CNTs have been widely used as metal-free catalysts and catalyst supports.\nIn this perspective, we first introduce the advantages of CNTs as electrocatalysts, then briefly discuss the applications of CNTs in oxygen electrocatalysis as metal-free catalysts, catalyst supports, and free-standing electrodes, and finally prospect for the future research directions and challenges of CNTs in oxygen electrocatalytic reactions toward the practical applications of FCs and MABs.\n2. Key Advantages of CNTs for Oxygen Electrocatalytic Reactions\nCNTs have attracted great attentions since 1991 when they were observed under a transmission electron microscope. (14−16) CNTs can be divided into single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) rolled from one graphene layer and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) rolled from two or more graphene layers. The unique one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure constructed with all sp2-hybridized carbon atoms endows CNTs with outstanding physical, chemical, and structural properties (Figure 1).\nFigure 1\nFigure 1. Key advantages of CNTs for oxygen electrocatalytic reactions.\nThe theoretical surface area of SWCNTs is as high as 1315 m2 g–1. (17) The continuous sp2-hybridized carbon structure brings CNTs excellent electrical conductivity of over 1 × 105 S m–1. (18,19) The Young’s modulus of the individual SWCNT can reach 1 TPa and the tensile strength can reach 100 GPa. (20,21) These properties make CNTs ideal materials for electrodes, which require the fast transport of electrons as well as robust structure.\nA CNT with well graphitized closed structure has few dangling bonds and defects, endowing it excellent stability and resistance to corrosion in various electrolytes. (22,23) The properties of CNTs can be modulated by covalent and non-covalent modifications such as doping with heteroatoms, grafting functional groups, and adsorption of molecules without obvious damage to the integrity of CNTs. (24,25) The functionalized CNTs with high electrocatalytic activities have been used as metal-free catalysts.

(24,25) The functionalized CNTs with high electrocatalytic activities have been used as metal-free catalysts. (26) Since the oxygen electrocatalytic reactions occurs at the three-phase interface of catalysts, electrolyte and oxygen, (27) the functionalized CNTs with tunable hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity are ideal substrate for anchoring active components to form hybrid catalysts. (28)\nDue to their superhigh length-diameter ratio, CNTs can be assembled into macroscopic assembles including 1D fibers, 2D films and papers, and 3D aerogels and sponges by various methods. (29) For example, 2D CNT films directly grown by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have an electrical conductivity of more than 2000 S cm–1. (30) Besides, CNT films can be buckled in a periodic wavy form, which exhibits excellent stretchability with almost invariant electrical resistance. (31) Therefore, CNTs are superior materials for free-standing electrodes. In addition, CNT assemblies with various pore structures can be obtained by adjusting the arrangement and density of CNTs during the assembly process. (32) Proper pore structure is crucial for mass transfer/diffusion.\n3. Roles of CNTs in Oxygen Electrocatalytic Reactions\n3.1. CNTs Used As Metal-Free Catalysts\nIn principle, defect-free CNTs with homogeneous π-electron clouds are inert for oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. (33) It has been proved that the defects formed inevitably during the tube growth process and edge carbon atoms are active sites for ORR, which can facilitate the hydrogenation of O2 to OOH* intermediate. (34−36) Heteroatom doping is another approach to endow CNTs with catalytic activity. N, O, B, S, and P, solely or jointly incorporated into CNTs, can lead to charge redistribution on the CNT surface, enhancing their ORR performance. (37,38)\nNitrogen-doped CNTs (NCNTs) have been extensively explored since Dai’s pioneering work. (39) The doped nitrogen atoms can regulate the charge distribution of neighboring carbon atoms, thereby promoting the adsorption of O2 on carbon surface. (26) There are four kinds of nitrogen species in CNTs including pyridinic, pyrrolic, graphitic, and oxidized nitrogen. Among them, pyridinic nitrogen has been widely reported contributing to catalytic activity. (40) Recently, Yu et al. concluded that the ORR activity depends on the ratios of pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen ([NP]:[NG]) in a reverse volcano curve (Figure 2a). (41) Both isolated pyridinic or graphitic nitrogen can enhance the ORR activity. Despite the intensive reports of NCNTs, the precise control of doping species in CNTs is still challenging.\nFigure 2\nFigure 2.

(c) Schematic diagram of the active sites on CNTs, C (black), metal (red), O (yellow), and N (blue).\nBasically, NCNTs can be prepared by in situ doping during CNT growth or post-growth doping. (42) Using nitrogen-containing organic compounds as sources of both nitrogen and carbon, the NCNTs synthesized directly by the CVD method are often in a bamboo-like structure with N atoms uniformly incorporated in the whole carbon skeleton. (39,43) For post-growth doping, the commonly used methods include heat treatment in a N-containing atmosphere, (44) hydrothermal reaction with ammonia, (45) and N2 plasma treatment. (46) The nitrogen atoms doped by this strategy are mainly distributed on the surface of CNTs. Wei et al. discovered the surface-doped CNT@NCNT exhibited better ORR and OER performance than the bulk doped bamboo-like NCNTs (Figure 2b). (47",

Wei et al. discovered the surface-doped CNT@NCNT exhibited better ORR and OER performance than the bulk doped bamboo-like NCNTs (Figure 2b). (47) In their opinion, the complex cup-stacked carbon layers in the bamboo-like NCNTs impede the rapid electron transport along the tube walls. Although bulk doped NCNTs have more N-doped sites, it is difficult for the electrolyte to contact the inside active sites, which hardly contribute to the catalytic activity.\nMost recently, it has been proved that the CNTs grown by CVD often contain atomic metal residues in the walls (e.g., Fe) even after an aggressive metal removing treatment, which have considerable contribution to the ORR activity. (48,49)Figure 2c summarizes the active sites on CNTs. It is worth noting that, in most cases, the synergistic effect of structural defects, heteroatom doping, and metallic impurities of CNTs contribute to the electrocatalytic performance. (50)\n3.2. CNTs Used As Catalyst Supports\nUsing CNTs as substrates to construct hybrid catalysts can lead to an improved catalytic activity. The currently developed oxygen catalysts include metals and alloys, (51,52) metal oxides, (53) hydroxides, (54) nitrides, (55) and phosphides. (56) In addition to developing more efficient catalysts, increasing the amount of active sites is an efficient way to improve the catalytic activity. The challenge lies in dispersing high-density and well-defined catalyst particles on CNTs, as they are easily aggregated during synthesis or degraded under extreme working conditions. (57) To solve these problems, there should be sufficient and uniform functionalization groups on the CNT surface, which can serve as the anchoring sites for metal catalysts. (58) Nakashima et al. reported the pyridine-based polybenzimidazole (PyPBI)-wrapped CNTs, which were integrated via strong π–π interactions without causing any structural damage to CNTs (Figure 3a). (59) The PyPBI layer on CNTs provides abundant anchoring sites, which ensures the uniform deposition of NixCo3–xO4 nanocrystals with 37 wt % and ∼5 nm size (Figure 3b).\nFigure 3\nFigure 3.

Copyright 2020 American Chemical Society.\nRecently, single-atom electrocatalysts (SACs) have become a new electrochemical research frontier because of their ultrahigh atomic utilization efficiency and superior catalytic activity. (60,61) SACs on carbon substrates with metal–N–C structure have been widely used as ORR and OER catalysts. (62,63) Compared with conventional carbon substrates that are highly defective, CNTs have better electrical conductivity and chemical stability because of the much higher graphitization degree. (64,65) A heteroatom-doped carbon layer precoated on CNT can be used as the substrate for SACs. (66,67) By pyrolyzing the in situ grown Fe-containing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks on CNTs, Li et al., synthesized a CNT supported Fe–N–C SACs (Fe-NC/rOCNT, Figure 3c). (68) As a conductive network, CNTs significantly improved the oxygen electrocatalytic performance of Fe–N–C SACs. Because of the high surface energy of SACs on CNTs, metal atoms at high loading tend to aggregate into nanoparticles during thermal activation (Figure 3d). A silica-protective-layer",

Because of the high surface energy of SACs on CNTs, metal atoms at high loading tend to aggregate into nanoparticles during thermal activation (Figure 3d). A silica-protective-layer assisted pyrolysis strategy has been developed and SiO2 can mitigate the thermal migration of metal atoms under high temperature (Figure 3e). (69)\n3.3. CNTs Used As Free-Standing Electrode\nTo date, most of reported CNT-based oxygen electrocatalysts are powders. A current collector is needed to load the catalysts, integrating into an oxygen electrode with the help of polymer binder. However, the weak physical contact and large interfacial resistance between catalysts and current collector restrict the battery performance. In addition, the growing market of wearable electronics has boosted the demand for flexible batteries, in which the electrodes need to meet the new challenge of mechanical deformation in different usage scenarios (e.g., bending, twisting, stretching). (70) The key to solving the above problems is to develop high-performance free-standing electrodes. CNTs can be assembled into diverse macroscopic assembles with superior conductivity, flexibility, and mechanical strength and therefore trigger broad application prospects in free-standing electrodes. (71,72)\nBenefiting from the high conductivity, large surface area, and adjustable hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, free-standing CNT assembles can simultaneously act as catalyst support, current collector, and gas diffusion layer. Thus, the integrated hybrid electrodes with good flexibility and electrochemical activity can be obtained. Wei et al. coated the porphyrin covalent organic framework on conductive long CNT scaffold (CNT@POF). (73) Interwoven into a freestanding film by vacuum filtration, the CNT@POF hybrid can be directly used as an air electrode for flexible solid-state ZAB (Figure 4a, b). Using a floating catalytic CVD method, Li et al. synthesized a CNT aerogel and used it as a free-standing catalyst–supporting scaffold. (74) Using a transient Joule heating method, they also synthesized PtFe metal alloy nanoparticles embedded in the CNT film (Figure 4d). (75) The obtained film directly acted as an integrated air cathode without additives. Peng et al. reported a flexible and stretchable electrode made from aligned CNT sheets (Figure 4e). (76) Benefiting from the rippled structure, this CNT electrode can withstand thousands of 100% stretching deformations repeatedly without obvious decay in electrical resistance.\nFigure 4\nFigure 4.

Future Directions and Challenges\nWe have introduced the progresses of CNTs as metal-free catalysts, catalyst supports, and free-standing electrodes in oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. Although great breakthroughs have been made, the real application of CNT-based catalysts for oxygen electrodes is still far away. Here are some future directions and challenges toward the practical applications.\n4.1. Controllable Functionalization of CNTs\nThe functionalized CNT surface is beneficial to increase the active sites, improve the interaction with active materials, and enhance the surface hydrophilicity of CNTs. However, functionalization always introduces defects into CNTs, resulting in lower chemical stability and electric conductivity of CNTs, especially in the OER process. (77,78) Therefore, balancing the functional degree and structure stability of CNTs is one of the practical problems. In addition, it is desired that the functionalization be property and location specified. Because the oxygen electrocatalytic reaction occurs at the three-phase interface, one side of the electrode needs to be hydrophilic to support the catalyst and provide access to the liquid electrolyte, whereas the other side needs to be hydrophobic to contact the air and prevent the electroly",

In addition, it is desired that the functionalization be property and location specified. Because the oxygen electrocatalytic reaction occurs at the three-phase interface, one side of the electrode needs to be hydrophilic to support the catalyst and provide access to the liquid electrolyte, whereas the other side needs to be hydrophobic to contact the air and prevent the electrolyte leakage. On the basis of the above requirements, the accurate control of the functionalization degree and uniformity of CNTs is a great challenge.\n4.2. Promoting Dual Efficiency toward ORR and OER\nHigh-efficiency bifunctional catalysts are desired for MABs. Both ORR and OER involve multi-step electron-transfer processes. Typically, the activities of ORR and OER are limited by the different intermediates’ reduction or formation steps. Thus, the best ORR catalyst with optimized intermediate binding energies normally cannot provide the best OER catalytic performance simultaneously, and vice versa. Therefore, combining two or more types of components on CNTs to construct hybrid catalysts is an effective strategy to prepare bifunctional oxygen catalysts, which provide different active sites for ORR and OER, respectively.\n4.3. Improving Catalyst Stability\nThe durability of oxygen catalysts has become an important issue that cannot be ignored in practical applications. CNTs with highly graphitized structure have natural advantages in stability test. The reported stability of catalysts in oxygen electrocatalytic reactions lasted from ∼10 to ∼100 h in laboratory trials. However, to satisfy the requirements of practical applications, the stability of CNT-based catalysts needs to be improved to more than 1000 h.\n4.4. Preparing High-Performance CNT Assembles\nIt is worth noting that focusing only on catalytic activity and stability is not enough to meet the challenge posed by flexible electrode. Thus, free-standing CNT assemblies with both high electrochemical performance and good flexibility are highly needed. The electrical conductivity and mechanical strength of an individual CNT are comparable to those of conventional metal electrodes. However, because of the weak interaction and large junction resistances between CNTs, (79) the performance of the assembled CNT film or aerogel is not satisfactory. Welding adjacent CNTs together by carbon, especially sp2-hybridized carbon, to form a cross-linking structure may be an effective strategy to improve the overall electrical and mechanical properties of the CNT assembles.\n4.5. Dynamic Monitoring of CNT Evolution during the Catalytic Process\nWith the progress of techniques, the characterization of the structure–function relationship of the catalysts from very high local resolution to dynamic observation have become available. (80) However, characterization is often limited to the metal sites in the initial phase of a reaction. More effort is necessary toward the evolution investigation of CNT substrate. Strategies of heteroatom doping and defect engineering are widely used in tuning the activity of CNT-based catalysts. However, their stability has not been systematically studied as the reaction time increases. Under high potential conditions, the defective carbon atoms and heteroatoms on CNTs may be oxidized first, and then leave the carbon skeleton to generate new defects simultaneously. The change in surface carbon structure not only affects the conductivity and hydrophilicity of CNT substrate, but also leads to the agglomeration or shedding of the surface-anchored catalysts, affecting the stability of the hybrid catalyst. Indeed, the mechanism of carbon corrosion under high potential is very complex. The monitoring and research on the degradation of CNTs in oxygen electrocatalytic reactions are still very challenging. The in situ and/or operando techniques developed recently for studying the mechanism of catalytic processes may also be applied for tracking the dynamic evolution of CNTs in the electrocatalytic reactions. For example, in situ Raman and XRD may be used to monitor the change of the graphitization degree of CNTs during the reaction process, and in situ TEM equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy can be used to unveil the evolution of morphology and heteroatom distribution of CNTs.\n5. Conclusions\nAttributed to the excellent conductivity and stability, CNTs have found important applications in oxygen electrocatalytic reactions. The key challenges for further promoting the practical applications of CNT-based catalysts include the controllable functionalization of CNTs, the improvement of catalyst activity and stability, and the assembly of CNTs.
