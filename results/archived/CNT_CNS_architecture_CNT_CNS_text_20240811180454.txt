In this work, we report the design of a novel nanostructured electrocatalyst consisting of carbon nanotube/carbon nanosheet architecture with N and Fe doping (NFe-CNT/CNS) by a SiO2-protected calcination strategy. The hierarchical structure of CNT/CNS affords abundant N-induced defects and Fe−N species as highly active sites and facilitates mass transportation, and carbon nanotube also offers a smooth route for charge transfer in the CO2RR process. These synergistic merits afford NFe-CNT/CNS with high performance for CO2RR in terms of a maximum FE of 69% at a low overpotential of 0.48 V, a small Tafel slope of 89 mV dec−1, and enhanced stability for CO production in aqueous solution. The findings demonstrate that the integration of structural design and dopants optimization is effective to boost electrocatalytic activity of nanocarbons for CO2 reduction.\nDownload: Download high-res image (492KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nThe heavy dependency on fossil fuels for the production of energy leads to a massive emission of greenhouse gases (mainly CO2) into the atmosphere, which results in severe environmental changes and threats to human's health. This urgent situation has triggered intensive research to mitigate CO2 concentrations by converting CO2 into valued fuels and chemicals to reach a carbon neutral cycle. Among various CO2 utilization techniques, electrochemical CO2 reduction in aqueous solution is believed to be one of the promising solutions because of its advantages including easy manipulation, reusability of electrolyte, low-cost electricity from renewable energy sources and high viability of large-scale applications [\n1\n,\n2\n]. However, this desired solution is technically impeded as CO2 is fully oxidized and thermodynamically stable, which causes prohibitively high overpotentials to achieve practical current densities [\n1\n,\n2\n].\nAs a heterogonous catalytic process in aqueous solution, CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) involves multi-electron and proton processes occurred on complex three-phase gas/solid/liquid interfaces, which is also accompanied by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The CO2RR process can thus produce variable products from CO to hydrocarbons, oxygenates and by-product H2 [\n3\n,\n4\n]. In contrast to hydrocarbons, CO formation only needs two electrons and two protons, making it a substantially less hindered reaction process [\n2\n,\n5\n]. Moreover, CO and by-product H2 (termed as syngas) can be used as feedstock in the Fischer−Tropsch process to produce synthetic liquid fuels without additional separation processes [\n6\n], rendering CO2RR to CO a competitive route. The most active catalysts for CO production are noble Ag and Au owing to the strong binding ability with COOH/CO2− and the weak binding strength with CO intermediates on Au and Ag surfaces [\n2\n,\n7\n]. However, the noble metals are not suitable for large-scale application due to their high cost and limited reserves. Searching high-performance catalysts composed of earth-abundant elements is thus highly required to achieve a cost-effective CO2-to-CO process.\nAlong with intensive research effort in developing nonprecious CO2RR catalysts, nitrogen-doped carbons (NCs) have been emerging as promising candidates by virtue of their advantages of tunable surface chemistry, fast electron transfer ability and rich reserves [\n4\n,\n8\n].

  "1": "effective CO2-to-CO process.\nAlong with intensive research effort in developing nonprecious CO2RR catalysts, nitrogen-doped carbons (NCs) have been emerging as promising candidates by virtue of their advantages of tunable surface chemistry, fast electron transfer ability and rich reserves [\n4\n,\n8\n]. N-doped nanotube [\n9\n], graphene [\n10\n], nanofibres [\n11\n], and carbon nitride/carbon nanotube composite [\n12\n] have been developed for CO2RR, which show competitive selectivity for catalyzing CO2 into CO. Experimental and computational results demonstrated that CO2RR origin on NCs is attributed to the charge redistribution induced by N atom, which creates active sites to adsorb CO2 and CO2−/COOH intermediates, albeit a controversy still remains regarding chemistry nature, active sites and reaction mechanism [\n10\n,\n13\n]. Very recently, the addition of metals in NCs (termed as M-N-C) was demonstrated to be effective in improving CO2RR performance, where M−NX complex was suggested to be the primary promoter in accelerating catalytic capability of NCs [\n[14]\n,\n[15]\n,\n[16]\n,\n[17]\n,\n[18]\n]. It is known that M-N-C, a typical catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction, is conventionally prepared through the pyrolysis of a mixture containing metals/nitrogen precursors and carbon supports at a high temperature. However, M-N-C usually suffers from high overpotentials in electrocatalytic reactions due to the low atomic efficiency of metals atoms caused by the formation of crystalline metallic phases, which leads to a low density of available M−NX sites [\n[19]\n,\n[20]\n,\n[21]\n]. In addition, a proper architecture of nanocarbons is also pivotal in boosting electrocatalytic activity. For example, great advancements on constructing functionalized carbon nanotube/graphene/g-C3N4 architectures have been achieved in the oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions [\n[22]\n,\n[23]\n,\n[24]\n,\n[25]\n,\n[26]\n]. Synergistic effects between these structures can not only improve sites density but also facilitate mass and charge transfers, contributing largely to electrocatalytic performance. Nevertheless, the use of M-N-C for CO2 reduction is still at an early stage, and there is much more to be done for enhancing activities by engineering catalyst architectures and dopants configurations.\nMotivated by above viewpoints, we considered the integration of favorable carbon architecture and dense dispersion of N/Fe dopants in carbon frameworks with enhanced synergetic effects to accelerate the electrocatalytic CO2RR activity. Herein, we designed and fabricated a novel electrocatalyst for efficient CO2RR featuring carbon nanotube (CNT)/carbon nanosheet (CNS) architecture decorated with N/Fe dopants (NFe-CNT/CNS) via a silica-protected calcination method. NFe-CNT/CNS has substantially enriched density of Fe−NX complex and N defects, and the interconnected architecture between CNT and CNS not only provides enhanced electrical conductivity but also facilitates mass transfer in CO2RR. These integrated advantages endow FeN-CNT/CNS with high electrocatalytic activity for CO2RR with a low onset overpotential of 0.19 V, a maximum FE of 69% for CO at an overpotential of 0.48 V, and a small Tafel slope of 89 mV dec−1. This work demonstrates that coupling the architectural design of nanocarbons and doping of Fe−N complex is conducive to improve electrocatalytic CO2RR performance for carbon-based catalysts.\nIn a typical synthesis process, commercial CNT (6–9 nm in diameter) was first treated with nitric acid (63%) for 12 h at 80 °C and subsequently with hydrochloric acid (37%) for 12 h at 80 °C to remove metal impurities. For the optimized preparation of NFe-CNT/CNS, the purified CNT (25 mg) was mixed with Iron Phthalocyanine (FePc, 50 mg) in an agate mortar and ground for 20 min to get a uniform mixture. The mixture was transferred into a tube furnace and heated at 400 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C",

For the optimized preparation of NFe-CNT/CNS, the purified CNT (25 mg) was mixed with Iron Phthalocyanine (FePc, 50 mg) in an agate mortar and ground for 20 min to get a uniform mixture. The mixture was transferred into a tube furnace and heated at 400 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under Ar ambiance to yield FePc/CNT composite. After cooling down to room temperature, FePc/CNT composite was mixed with 0.25 mL tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and 0.25 mL formic acid in a mortar, then ground and dried at 60 °C to obtain FePc/CNT/Si composite. Dried FePc/CNT/Si composite was ground to a homogeneous powder, which was calcined at 850 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 under Ar. Calcined FePc/CNT/Si composite was washed with 5% HF for four times and with isopropanol for two times and dried at 60 °C to yield final NFe-CNT/CNS. To optimize CO2RR activity, mass contents of precursors and annealing temperature were adjusted (\nFig. S1\n). As a reference, the catalyst prepared in the same manner as for NFe-CNT/CNS except without adding TEOS and formic acid was named as NFe@CNT.\nThe morphology, structure, and compositions of as-prepared catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F20 ST) field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM7500F), X-ray diffraction (XRD, BRIKER D8), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Omicron's DAR 400).\nElectrocatalytic CO2RR was carried out in a two-compartment three-electrode cell in 0.1 M CO2-saturated KHCO3 electrolyte (pH = 6.8). A Pt flake and an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The measured potentials after iR compensation were rescaled to the reversible hydrogen electrode by E (RHE) = E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.210 V + 0.0591V × pH. The working electrode was prepared by drop casting 60 μL of catalyst ink onto a carbon paper (1 cm2) with a mass loading of 0.3 mg cm2. The ink was prepared by dispersing 3 mg catalyst in mixture solution of 200 μL DI-water, 370 μL ethanol and 30 μL 5% Nafion solution via sonication for 3 h. The working and reference electrodes were placed in the cathode chamber, while the counter electrode was placed in the anode chamber, which was separated by a piece of Nafion 115 ionic exchange membrane. The high purity CO2 was introduced in the cathode chamber for 1 h before electrolysis with a flow rate of 34 mL min−1 and maintained this flow rate during tests, and the electrolyte in the cathode chamber was stirred by a stirring stick at a rotation rate of 900 rpm. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were collected in a frequency range of 100 kHz to 5 mHz with an amplitude of 5 mV at −0.59 V. The durability test was conducted by a chronoamperometric technique at −0.59 V. The gas-phase products were analyzed by using an online gas chromatograph (GC, Fuel Cell GC-2014ATF, Shimadzu) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a methanizer assisted flame ionization detector (FID).\nThe Faradaic efficiency (FE) of products at each applied potential was calculated based on an equation as follows:\nwhere z is the number of electrons transferred per mole of gas product (z is 2 for CO and H2, z is 8 for CH4), P is pressure (1.01 × 105 Pa), F is the Faraday constant (96500C mol−1), V is the gas flow rate (5.67 × 107 m−3�",

Partial current densities of CO were determined by calculating total current densities multiplied by FEs of CO.\nThe process of fabricating NFe-CNT/CNS is illustrated in\nFig. 1\n. The synthesis is achieved by a two-step solid-state annealing approach involving a SiO2 coating-protected strategy. The strong π−π interactions between FePc and CNT annealed at 400 °C boost the formation of compacted FePc/CNT composite (\nFig. S2\n). The hydrolysis of TEOS leads to the filling and coating of SiO2 in pore and surface of FePc/CNT composite (\nFig. S3\n). During the high-temperature carbonization, SiO2 coatings function as space-enclosed nanoreactors to promote the formation of graphene-like carbon layers from the decomposition and rearrangement of FePc that attaches on CNT (\nFig. S4\n). In addition, SiO2 wrapping can also serve to prevent irreversible aggregation of Fe species and loss of nitrogen-containing precursors from the thermolysis of FePc [\n27\n], leading to the formation of dense atomic N/Fe clusters dispersing in CNT/CNS. The etching of SiO2 yields the final NFe-CNT/CNS catalyst.\nFig. 1. The synthetic process for NFe-CNT/CNS by a SiO2-coated calcination strategy.\nThe morphology and structure of NFe-CNT/CNS were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A TEM image in\nFig. 2\na clearly shows the generation of interconnected CNT and graphene-like CNS architectures. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (\nFig. 2\nb) indicates that CNT is intimately attached on CNS, confirming the intimate contact between these two materials in the complex. In addition, CNT is found to retain the high crystallinity without being damaged, which can provide high electrical conductivity. The electrical connection between CNT and CNS may be strengthened by π–π stacking interactions [\n22\n]. For a better understanding of the formation process for CNT/CNS architectures, controlled experiment was performed. To verify the function of SiO2 coating, the synthesis was carried out in the same manner as for NFe-CNT/CNS except without addition of TEOS, and the obtained sample is labeled as NFe@CNT.\nFig. S5\nshows that NFe@CNT presents aggregated CNT with obvious metal nanoparticles. A HRTEM image reveals that the metal nanoparticles are encased by CNT shells. The generation of CNT via metal Fe as the core is because Fe is a typically active catalyst for catalyzing the nucleation and growth of nanotube structure using carbon intermediates from the decomposition of FePc [\n28\n,\n29\n]. These obvious differences in the structure between NFe-CNT/CNS and NFe@CNT confirm the pivotal role of SiO2 coating for the dispersion of Fe species and the formation of CNT/CNS structure. We attribute this function to the space-confinement effect of SiO2 coating, which may provide a space-enclosed environment to impede the growth of Fe nanoparticles, leading to the generation of numerous Fe–N components and CNS attached on CNT [\n27\n].\nFig. 2.

XRD patterns (c) and Raman spectra of NFe-CNT/CNS and NFe@CNT.\nThe structural properties of as-prepared samples were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in\nFig. 2\nc, XRD pattern of NFe-CNT/CNS shows two distinct peaks centered at 25.9 and 42.9°, corresponding to (002) and (100) planes of graphitic carbon. This XRD pattern is similar to that of annealed purified CNT (\nFig. S6\n), and no metal phase was observed. By contrast, in addition to carbon phases, NFe@CNT also presents obvious Fe/Fe3C metallic phases. The difference in Fe forms in these two catalysts can also be confirmed by comparing their magnetic properties. As can be seen in\nFig. S7\n, NFe-CNT/CNS is nonmagnetic, whereas NFe@CNT exhibits magnetism because of the existence of metallic Fe/Fe3C. These results imply that Fe may be in the form of non-crystallographic phase like Fe−N coordinations distributed in NFe-CNT/CNS. Raman spectroscopy was further carried out to characterize carbon structure (\nFig. 2\nd). The spectra show a D band centered at 1357 cm−1 and a G band at 1595 cm−1, which correspond to the K-point phonons of A1g symmetry reflecting the disorder-induced character in the aromatic rings and the E2g stretching vibration mode of sp2 carbon atoms [\n30\n], respectively. Quantitatively, the ID/IG values are 1.45 for NFe-CNT/CNS and 1.37 for NFe@CNT, implying a larger content of disordered carbon in NFe-CNT/CNS compared to NFe@CNT.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate surface compositions and chemical states of N/Fe dopants. The survey spectrum reveals the presence of C, N, O and Fe in NFe-CNT/CNS and NFe@CNT, while annealed CNT only shows C and O peaks (\nFig. 3\na–b,\nFig. S8\n). This reveals the successful incorporation of N/Fe species in carbon frameworks. The contents of N and Fe were estimated to be 3.86 at.% for N and 0.52 at.% for Fe in NFe@CNT, as well as 4.64 at.% for N and 0.66 at.% for Fe in NFe-CNT/CNS. It was found that the surface N content in NFe-CNT/CNS is slightly higher than that in NFe@CNT. This may be attributed to SiO2 wrapping in the synthesis of NFe-CNT/CNS that effectively inhibits severe loss of N-containing gases from the decomposition of FePc in space-enclosed circumstances, providing enough N sources and thus increasing total N doping levels. The relatively low level of Fe in NFe@CNT might be due to the formation of Fe particles covered by CNT shells. The high-resolution Fe 2p spectrum of NFe-CNT/CNS can be deconvoluted into two peaks at 710.1 and 712.2 eV, coorresponding to Fe2+ and Fe3+ (insert of\nFig. 3\na–b), respectively [\n31\n]. As for NFe@CNT, it presents not only Fe2+/Fe3+ peaks but also a prominent peak at 706.2 eV (\nFig. 3\nb), which is assigned to metallic Fe [\n19\n]. These results further highlight the non-metallic Fe phase in NFe-CNT/CNS, consistent well with TEM and XRD results.\nFig. 3\nc depicts the high-resolution N 1s spectrum of NFe-CNT/CNS, which can be divided into five species located at 398.3, 399.4, 400.5, 401.3 and 402.9 eV, ascribing to pyridinic N, Fe−NX complex, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidized N, respectively [\n[32]\n,\n[33]\n,\n[34]\n,\n[35]\n].

It is noted that the categories of N species in NFe@CNT are similar to that in NFe-CNT/CNS (\nFig. 3\nd), whereas NFe@CNT has lower percentages of Fe−NX and pyrrolic N, as well as a higher percentage of graphitic N compared to NFe-CNT/CNS (\nTable S1\n). The difference in catalyst architecture and dopants configurations might have great effects on their CO2RR performance.\nFig. 3. XPS survey spectra of (a) NFe-CNT/CNS and (b) NFe@CNT. Insert of (a,b) are corresponding high-resolution Fe 2p3/2 spectra. High-resolution N 1s spectra of (c) NFe-CNT/CNS and (d) NFe@CNT.\nThe electrocatalytic CO2RR activity was evaluated using a two-chamber cell in 0.1 M CO2-saturated KHCO3 solution. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were first performed to compare activity for CNT, NFe@CNT, and NFe-CNT/CNS. The polarization curves shown in\nFig. 4\na present normalized current densities versus voltages. It was observed that NFe@CNT and NFe-CNT/CNS exhibit more positive onset potentials and higher current densities than CNT, implying that chemical doping of N,Fe results in a great enhancement in CO2 reduction of CNT. Among them, NFe-CNT/CNS is identified as the best catalyst with the highest current densities. To determine products in CO2RR, a chronoamperometric technique was carried out at different applied potentials. CO and H2 were detected as main gaseous products, which give a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) more than 98%. A trace amount of CH4 was also observed with FE of about 0.2% at more negative potentials (\nFig. S9\n); no liquid product was observed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) test (\nFig. S10\n).\nFig. 4\nb shows FEs for CO and H2 on NFe-CNT/CNS electrode. It can be seen that NFe-CNT/CNS exhibits the occurrence of CO2 reduction at −0.3 V with a FE of 5%, meaning a low onset overpotential of 0.19 V, given the equilibrium potential of −0.11 V (vs. RHE) for CO2/CO couple at pH of 6.8 [\n36\n]. A maximum CO FE is achieved to be 69% at −0.59 V. This achievable maximum FE (69%) for CO of NFe-CNT/CNS is slightly lower than that of state-of-the-art electrocatalysts (∼80%), such as polycrystalline Ag [\n37\n], N-doped CNT [\n13\n], and NFe-doped carbon [\n18\n]. However, it is worth noting that the overpotential required to reach the highest FE for CO is 0.48 V on NFe-CNT/CNS, which is significantly smaller relative to that of polycrystalline Ag (1.04 V) [\n37\n], cobalt−porphyrin MOF (0.58 V) [\n38\n], g-C3N4/MWCNTs (0.64 V) [\n12\n], as well as comparable to MOF-derived NFe-doped carbon (0.48 V) [\n18\n]. Detailed comparisons between the activities of NFe-CNT/CNS in this work and the ones reported in the literature are provided in\nTable S2\n. These results reflect a less energy input to yield a selective reduction of CO2 to CO on NFe-CNT/CNS electrode.\nFig. 4.

(a) LSV curves of CNT, NFe@CNT, and NFe-CNT/CNS in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solution. (b) FEs for CO and H2 of NFe-CNT/CNS.\nThe long-term chronoamperometric response further shows that NFe-CNT/CNS has enhanced durability (\nFig. S11\n). In addition, products FEs are demonstrated to be highly dependent on applied potentials. Specifically, CO FEs increase from 5% to 69% as potential sweeps from −0.3 to −0.59 V. When potentials go to more negatively, a decrease in CO FEs is observed. This potential-dependent characteristic of FEs may be ascribed to the change of rate-determining factor from a kinetic-controlled region at low overpotentials to a mass transportation-limited region at high overpotentials. We also note that FE tendency of H2 shows a sharp decrease and then increase, which is opposite to that of CO. This phenomenon has been observed previously [\n7\n], and a possible explanation is that the CO2 reduction needs high overpotentials to occur than HER.\nThe CO FEs and partial current densities of NFe-CNT/CNS are further compared to those of CNT and NFe@CNT to verify possible catalytic sites and benefits of CNT/CNS architectures in CO2RR. Compared to pristine CNT heated at 850 °C that presents the occurrence of CO2RR at −0.5 V (\nFig. S12\n), the onset potential of CO2 reduction shifts to a more positive potential of −0.4 V on NFe@CNT and −0.3 V on NFe-CNT/CNS (\nFig. 5\na). The maximum CO FE of CNT is about 4%, which is extremely smaller than that of NFe-doped counterparts. These results unambiguously confirm that the indispensable function of N/Fe dopants in transforming pristine CNT into active electrocatalysts for CO2RR. According to theoretical computational results, the doping of N and Fe into carbon lattices leads to the redistribution of charge density and spin density, creating positively charged atoms for CO2 and intermediates adsorption [\n39\n,\n40\n]. On the other hand, NFe@CNT presents a maximum FE of 47% and a current density of 0.15 mA cm−2 for CO at −0.59 V (\nFig. 5\nb), which are much lower than those of NFe-CNT/CNS (FE of 69%, JCO of 0.82 mA cm−2). While NFe@CNT presents low FEs for CO at overall potentials, it shows higher FEs for H2 than NFe-CNT/CNS (\nFig. S13\n). This manifests that H2 selectivity of NFe@CNT is better compared with NFe-CNT/CNS, which might be resulted from different catalytic centers for H2 and CO. The TEM, XRD and XPS characterizations have demonstrated that the main difference of N,Fe dopants in these two catalysts is that Fe exists in the form of Fe−NX in NFe-CNT/CNS, whereas NFe@CNT mainly possesses Fe metallic phase in the form of Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles. Therefore, the outstanding enhancement in CO selectivity on NFe-CNT/CNS might be partially attributed to the presence of abundant Fe−N complex as main active sites coupled with C−NX. By contrast, Fe-based nanoparticles prefer to reduce proton for H2 production, which is in line with recent report of iron nanoparticles encapsulated by carbon shell as highly active catalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction [\n41\n]. In addition to favorable active centers of NFe-CNT/CNS, its enhanced activity may also be derived from the architectural CNT/CNS structure compared with NFe@CNT. The CNS may provide abundant places to hold Fe−N and C−N sites, while the CNT mainly serves to transfer electrons.

Therefore, it might be the intergrated effects of favorable composition and texture structures that give rise to enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction on NFe-CNT/CNS electrode.\nFig. 5. (a) FEs and (b) partial current densities for CO of NFe@CNT and NFe-CNT/CNS in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution.\nTo gain further insight into the mechanistic pathway for two-electron reduction of CO2 to CO, Tafel analyses were conducted.\nFig. 6\na shows Tafel plots (log(JCO) versus overpotential (η)). We found that there is a linear region over the range of overpotentials from 0.29 to 0.49 V with a slope of 120 mV dec−1 on NFe@CNT, which is close to reported results on polycrystalline Ag catalysts [\n7\n,\n37\n]. This slope reveals that the transfer of the first electron for CO2 activation is the rate-determining step as previous findings demonstrated that the first electron transfer requires a much more negative potential compared to the following reduction steps [\n7\n,\n13\n]. As for NFe-CNT/CNS, it shows a Tafel slope of 89 mV dec−1 at overpotentials from 0.19 to 0.39 V. A smaller Tafel slope means that overpotentials increases slowly with increasing of current densities. Therefore, a low Tafel slope of 89 mV dec−1 suggests that CO2RR on NFe-CNT/CNS has a faster initial electron transfer to a CO2 molecule compared to that on NFe@CNT, indicative of a higher kinetic rate. By comparing Tafel slope of NFe-CNT/CNS with reported results, it is highlighted that the Tafel slope of 89 mV dec−1 is even lower than many typical non-precious catalysts for CO2RR, such as copper hollow fibres (93 mV dec−1) [\n42\n], N-doped CNT (203 mV dec−1) [\n13\n], cobalt−porphyrin MOF (165 mV dec−1) [\n38\n], and even polycrystalline Ag (130 mV dec−1) [\n7\n]. In view of Tafel analyses and previous studies [\n7\n,\n13\n], elementary reaction steps of CO2RR on NFe-CNT/CNS are proposed as follows (* presents possible active sites):\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n*CO → CO\nFig. 6. (a) Tafel plots of CO partial current density and (b) Nyquist plots for NFe@CNT and NFe-CNT/CNS in CO2-saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 aqueous solution.\nIn the fist step, one electron is transferred to CO2 and forms a CO2− intermediate adsorbed on the surface of NFe-CNT/CNS (1). Subsequently, the CO2− combines with another electron and two protons, forming CO* and H2O (2). The desorption of CO from NFe-CNT/CNS releases gaseous CO as the final product (3). The enhanced activity of NFe-CNT/CNS implies that Fe−NX may possess higher ability to enable the formation and stabilization of CO2− intermediate than Fe-based metallic phases.\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were carried out to further figure out advantages of NFe-CNT/CNS in CO2RR.\nFig. 6\nb presents Nyquist plots, and the inset shows magnified plots in high frequence regions.

From magnified Nyquist plots, NFe-CNT/CNS and NFe@CNT show same but small ohmic resistance, indicating the better electronic conductivity that may be resulted from the high conductive nature of CNT. Notably, NFe-CNT/CNS presents a lower interface charge transfer resistance and a lower Nernst diffusion impedance based on the smaller diameter of these two semicircles in comparison with those of NFe@CNT [\n22\n]. It has been well established that the charge transfer resistance is related to the number of electrons transferred from catalyst surface to reactant as well as intermediate formation and Nernst diffusion impedance corresponds to mass transportation [\n44\n,\n45\n]. Thus, smaller charge transfer resistance and Nernst diffusion impedance of NFe-CNT/CNS suggest an accelerated charge transfer and a soomther mass delivery, eventually boosting activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO.\nIn summary, we have synthesized a hierarchically structured electrocatalyst based on CNT/CNS architecture decorated by Fe and N. The optimized NFe-CNT/CNS was applied for CO2RR and showed high catalytic activity with a low onset overpotential of 0.19 V, a Tafel slope of 89 mV dec−1 and a maximum FE of 69% for CO production. The enhanced activity is attributed to the integrated synergetic effects between 3D hierarchical nanotubes/nanosheets structure and uniformly dispersed N and Fe dopants, which provides highly dense distribution of active species, enhanced mass and charge transfer in the CO2 reduction process. Moreover, obtained results established that the Fe−N complexes are more active for CO production than the metallic Fe nanoparticles that prefer proton reduction to H2. Such conclusion provides a significant guideline to design catalysts for achieving enhanced CO selectivity by maximizing Fe−N contents in nanocarbons. Also importantly, this work opens a new avenue for the development of advanced electrocatalysts in CO2 electroreduction by combining construction of unique architectural structure and optimization of catalytic functionalities.\nThis work was supported by American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund (ACS-PRF\n#58167-ND10\n).

However, the majority of the literature reports using CNTs solely as the carbon precursor suffer from multiple aforementioned disadvantages due to pre-/post-pyrolysis treatments [19,23,24]. As demonstrated in our previous work, the metal impurities often found in CNTs from the industrial synthesis can be utilized as the metal precursors for the MNC catalyst, eliminating the additional metal requirement and post-pyrolysis acid-washing [7].\nCookies are used by this site.\nCookie Settings\nAll content on this site: Copyright © 2024 Elsevier B.V., its licensors, and contributors.
