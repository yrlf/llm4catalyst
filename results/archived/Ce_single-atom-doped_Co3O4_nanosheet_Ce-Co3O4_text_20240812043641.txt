Owing to the enhanced charge transfer and decreased d−p band centers resulting from Ce incorporation, the obtained Ce single-atom-doped Co3O4 nanosheet exhibits greatly enhanced OER performance. It achieves 10 mA cm−2 current density under a small overpotential of 348 mV in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution with excellent stability.\nIntroduction\nWater splitting to produce hydrogen has received more and more attention and has two half reactions, i.e., oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction. OER is kinetically slow due to its four-electron transfer process, compared to the hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, acid media has advantages such as high-pressure compatibility over basic media for the OER reaction. Unfortunately, only a few noble metal catalysts based on Ir or Ru have been reported to exhibit high OER activity in acidic conditions. (1−5) However, their scarcity severely limits the large-scale production of electrochemical water splitting. The development of a robust, non-noble metal-based electrocatalyst is therefore critical for clean and green water splitting. Among non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts, spinel Co3O4 has attracted extensive attention due to its decent OER electrocatalytic activity. (6−9) However, its activity still cannot be compared with that of IrO2 or RuO2, (10,11) especially under harsh, acidic operating conditions.\nHeteroatom-incorporating is considered an important way to optimize the catalytic activity. For instance, Wen et al. (12) introduced Cr dopant into CoFe-layered double hydroxides. As a new active site, Cr dopants could improve the electron donation ability, resulting in excellent OER electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solutions. Li et al. (13) reported Ti-doped SnO2 as the substrate of IrO2. The incorporation of Ti stabilizes the particle size and improves the conductivity of SnO2. In addition, the synergistic effect between the active species and the Ti elements gave them excellent OER activity. Moreover, Jin and co-workers (14) reported a redoped rutile RuO2 electrocatalyst in which the Re dopant undergoes dynamic electron accepting–donating, resulting in excellent OER performance in acidic media.\nSingle-atom incorporation usually induces unique electronic structure and high surface-active centers and therefore becomes a hot topic in the field of catalysis. Doping metal single atoms into the transition metal oxides has been intensively proven to be an effective way to adjust the local crystal structure and electronic structure of the doped oxides so as to reduce the required overpotential and improve the intrinsic activity. (15,16) For example, in our previous work, (17) we designed a simple method to anchor the Ir single atoms into the Co3O4, enabling the regulation on chemical environment of the Ir and oxygen, and the lattice oxygen provided lone electrons and charges to balance the Ir single atoms, which greatly enhanced the OER activity and durability of the catalysis. Recently, rare-earth elements can be used as effective dopants to tune the electronic structure of transition metal-based catalysts because of the multiple coordination numbers and unique properties of 4f subshell orbitals. (18)\nThe acidic OER performance of rare-earth metal single-atom incorporation on non-noble metal oxides has rarely been studied. In this work, we successfully incorporate Ce single atoms into the octahedral site of Co3O4 by sol-flame annealing method. Owing to the advantages of structure and composition, the obtained Ce15-Co3O4 exhibits excellent OER performance, only requiring 348 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm–2 in acidic media, and it can run stably for 25 h. This is of great guiding significance for developing more economical and effective non-noble metal catalysts.\nExperimental Section\nAll chemicals were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. without further purification, and no uncommon hazards are noted. Carbon paper (CP, TORAY) was subsequently washed with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, respectively, under sonication and then vacuumed dry at 60 °C before usage.\nSynthesis of Co3O4: Co3O4 was synthesized following previously reported literature procedures with minor modifications.

(19) In 0.05 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous electrolyte, the carbon paper was used as the working electrode, and the Ag/AgCl and Pt plates were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively, to conduct constant potential electrodeposition (−1.0 V vsAg/AgCl, 10 min) at room temperature. Note that salt bridges are used to further protect the reference electrodes during electrodeposition. The deposited Co(OH)2 was carefully washed several times with deionized water and ethanol and dried. Finally, samples were calcined at 400 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 2.0 °C min–1 under the atmosphere of air to convert to Co3O4 (∼0.25 mg cm–2).\nSynthesis of Cex-Co3O4: Ce single-atom-doped Co3O4 was synthesized according to our previous method. (17) In short, the Co3O4 deposited on the carbon paper was immersed vertically in a 0.05 M Ce(NO3)3·6H2O aqueous solution and then withdrawn vertically at a constant speed. After the sample was dried in air to remove excess solvent, it was annealed at about 2.5 cm above the outer flame of the alcohol blast burner premixed with C2H5OH (fuel) and air (oxidizer) for 60 s, followed by a fast room-temperature cooling process. To obtain different Ce doping concentrations, the immersion time was 10, 15, and 20 s, respectively, which was named Ce10-Co3O4, Ce15-Co3O4, and Ce20-Co3O4, respectively.\nCharacterizations\nCrystal structure was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) with a 10°min–1 scan rate. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini300), the morphology was characterized by different magnifications under the accelerated voltage of 15 kV. Elemental composition was identified by an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyzer. Using a high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM, FEI Themis Z), the fine structure of the samples and the distribution pattern of doping elements were further observed under the conditions of accelerating voltage of 300 kV and spectral resolution of 0.2 eV. Using Al Kα as X-ray source and C 1s = 284.80 eV combined energy standard, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to measure the electronic states on the surface of the sample under the operating voltage of 12 kV and a filament current of 6 mA. Using Bruker Vertex 70 instrument, the infrared curves of the samples were collected. Using a Raman spectrometer with RM1000, the samples were Raman tested at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and a scanning range of 100–1000 cm–1.\nElectrochemical Measurements\nThe OER electrochemical performance of the catalysts was evaluated on a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation (CHI Instrument, Shanghai, China) using a standard three-electrode system at room temperature. To calibrate the reference, Pt sheet was used as both the working and counter electrode with a Hg/Hg2SO4 electrode as the reference electrode. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted at a scan rate of 1 mV s–1 in a H2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Thermodynamic potential of the hydrogen electrode reaction was calculated by taking the average value of the two potentials at zero current, and converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) via a formula: ERHE = EHg/Hg2SO4 + 0.659 V (Figure S1). Before electrochemical measurements, the electrolyte was purified by O2 for about 30 min. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) tests with scan rate of 5 mV/s were carried out in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution using Hg/Hg2SO4 as the reference, Pt plate as the counter electrodes, and the carbon paper with catalysts as the working electrode (area 0.25 cm2), which were performed after cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (measured from 0.05 to 1.5 V vs RHE)",

All polarization curves were corrected by 90% iR compensation. The electrical double-layer capacitor (Cdl) was measured from double-layer charging curves using cyclic voltammograms in potential range of 0.2–0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl with scan rate from 20 to 70 mV s–1. By plotting the anodic and cathodic current density difference curve (i.e., ΔJ = Ja – Jc) at 0.35 V vs Ag/AgCl against the scan rate, the linear slope is equivalent to twice the double-layer capacitance Cdl. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were tested in frequency range of 10000–0.05 Hz. The stability test was carried out at a constant current density of 10 mA cm–2 without iR compensation.\nComputational Details\nAll calculations were conducted under density functional theory (DFT) using Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package, with pseudopotentials reported previously. (20) The Monkhorst–Pack k-point samplings were 4 × 4 × 4. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 600 eV, the energy convergence criterion was 10–6 eV, and the residual forces on each atom was 0.01 eV/Å. The vacuum slab is 16 Å. The free energies of each reaction intermediates were determined according to previous reports. (16,21) The approximation was corrected by DFT + U method with Ueff = 3.32 and 5.0 eV for Co 3d and Ce 4f, respectively.\nResults and Discussion\nCe single-atom (SA) incorporated Co3O4 were synthesized by a simple sol-flame annealing method (see Supporting Information for details). Briefly, Co3O4 nanosheets were first synthesized through electrodeposition and then dipped in a Ce(NO3)3 aqueous solution, and then annealed in a flame of an ethanol torch. The total processing time is around 1 min. Adjusting the immersing durations obtains varied Ce loading amount. 10, 15, and 20 s immersing samples were denoted as Cex-Co3O4 with x values of 10, 15, and 20, respectively. The prepared Co3O4 and Ce SA-doped Co3O4 samples all exhibit nanosheet morphology (Figures 1a,b, and S2). Thin nanosheets are beneficial to provide larger surface area and expose more active sites, favoring charge and mass transportation. (22−25) The corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Figure S3) match well with spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS#42-1467), but the peak positions of Ce-doped Co3O4 shift slightly to lower angles, compared to pristine Co3O4, indicating the lattice expansion due to Ce incorporation. (26) Moreover, A1g band in Raman spectra displays a slight red shift after Ce incorporation (Figure S4). Given that A1g band correlates to octahedral cations while other bands such as F2g(1) band correlates to tetrahedral cations, the shift therefore suggests that incorporated Ce is located in the octahedron (the position of Co3+ site) rather than in the tetrahedrons. (27) The chemical structure of the samples is further determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) (Figure S5), and all samples show the characteristic band of Co3O4, further indicating the well maintenance of the crystal structure, benefiting good stability. (28) Further elemental mapping by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) reveals evenly distributed elements in the samples (Figure S6).\nFigure 1\nFigure 1. SEM images of Co3O4 (a) and Ce15-Co3O4 (b).

Insert in (e): corresponding SAED.\nThe aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image of Ce15-Co3O4 clearly shows Ce SA dispersed in the lattice of Co3O4 (Figure 1c). The lattice spacing of 0.247 and 0.286 nm correspond to the (311) and (220) planes of Co3O4, respectively (Figure 1e). Compared to the lattice spacing of 0.244 nm on the (311) plane of Co3O4, the incorporation of Ce causes lattice expansion, which is consistent with the XRD and Raman observations. In addition, the corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of the selected area further proves the polycrystalline nature of the sample (Figure 1e, illustration). In addition, the HRTEM observation also indicates pores in the nanosheets (Figure 1d), favoring the electrocatalytic activity. (29) HAADF-STEM elemental mapping (Figure S7) further displays that Ce distributed on the nanosheets in the form of single atom without aggregations.\nXPS was employed to reveal the interaction and charge transfer between elements in the samples. XPS survey (Figure 2a) shows only Ce, Co, and O elements without other elemental impurities. High-resolution XPS spectrum of Ce 3d (Figure 2b) shows three main peaks, namely Ce 3d5/2 at 893–878 eV, Ce 3d3/2 at 920–914 and 910–895 eV, respectively. Ce 3d XPS reveals that Ce mainly exists in the form of Ce3+and Ce4+, which exhibit rich redox characteristics in oxygen activation. The redox conversion of Ce3+/Ce4+ can effectively promote the rapid diffusion of oxygen and the kinetics of oxygen released in the lattice; thus, Ce doping promotes electronic interactions. (30,31) High-resolution Co 2p XPS spectrum shows two main spin-orbit peaks attributed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2(Figure 2c), respectively, and it clearly shows that the orbital peaks of Co 2p and O 1s were negatively shifted and the binding energy was reduced compared with Co3O4. Additionally, a lower ratio of Co3+ and a higher ratio of Co2+ could be seen, and specifically, the ratio of Co2+ to Co3+ in Co3O4 and Ce-Co3O4 increased from 1.84 to 1.91. Appropriate Co2+ is conducive to promoting the OER activity of the sample, because Co2+ is generally considered the active site of OER. (32) Additionally, as shown in Figure 2d, the doping of Ce also makes the binding energy of O 1s XPS move to the low energy direction, which means that there are abundant oxygen defects in the sample. (33) Moreover, the O 1s XPS of Co3O4 can be divided into three different types of oxygen, namely lattice oxygen O1 bound to metal at 530.29 eV, oxygen defect O2 with insufficient coordination at 531.69 eV, and adsorbed water O3 at 533.30 eV. The proportion of oxygen-deficient O2 in Ce15-Co3O4 is 27.3%, which is significantly increased compared to 24.2% of Co3O4. The generation of oxygen defects will contribute to the improvement of catalyst activity. (33) Ce L3-edge XANES spectroscopy measurements reveal a different feature compared to CeO2 (Figure 2e). CeO2 displays two well-separated maximum peaks of lower intensity (around 5732 and 5739 eV), while Ce15-Co3O4 exhibits a strong single peak at 5726 eV, which can be ascribed to Ce3+. The Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS, Figure 2f) analysis revealed a strong broader peak at 2.09 Å, which can be ascribed to Ce–O (1.95–2.12 Å in CeO6 octahedra). The EXAFS fittings results (Figure 2g and Table S1) display that the coordination numbers of Ce–O are 5.7, and the absence",

The Fourier-transformed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (FT-EXAFS, Figure 2f) analysis revealed a strong broader peak at 2.09 Å, which can be ascribed to Ce–O (1.95–2.12 Å in CeO6 octahedra). The EXAFS fittings results (Figure 2g and Table S1) display that the coordination numbers of Ce–O are 5.7, and the absence of Ce–Ce (∼3.58 Å) peak well demonstrates the single-atom nature of Ce in Co3O4.\nFigure 2\nFigure 2.

(g) FT-EXAFS fitting curve of Ce-Co3O4.\nThe OER performance of Ce SA-doped Co3O4 are evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4 using a standard three-electrode system. Ce incorporation induces improved activity, as indicated in Figure 3a,b. With the increase of doping amount, the activity increased to reach the highest one, Ce15-Co3O4, and further increasing the doping amount decreases the activity correspondingly. The corresponding loading amount of Ce in Ce15-Co3O4 is 3.19 at.% (Co at.% in transition metals) according to inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry measurements (Table S2). Ce can be used as an auxiliary catalyst to benefit the Co3O4 electrode, and the strong electron interaction between the two can effectively promote the oxygen-containing intermediates, reduce the adsorption free energy of various intermediates, and significantly improve the catalyst activity to be significantly improved. Compared with the overpotential required for Co3O4 sample to reach the current densities of 10, 20, and 50 mA cm–2 (435, 464, and 519 mV), the overpotentials of Ce15-Co3O4 sample (Figure 3c) are only 348, 370, and 406 mV, respectively, which far exceeded most of the non-noble metal-based OER electrocatalysts reported in the literature, as shown in Table S3.\nFigure 3\nFigure 3. (a) OER polarization curves. (b) Corresponding Tafel slopes. (c) Overpotentials histograms of samples at 10, 20, and 50 mA cm–2, respectively. (d) Double-layer capacitance plots. (e) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the samples. (f) Chronopotentiometric stability test of Ce15-Co3O4 and Co3O4 at 10 mA cm–2.\nIn order to further explore the intrinsic catalytic activity of the samples, the electrochemical surface areas are estimated by double-layer capacitances (Cdl) measurements (Figures 3d and S8 and Table S4). As indicated, the Ce15-Co3O4 sample has a Cdl of 4.59 mF cm–2, 1.57 times higher than that of Co3O4, indicating more surface-active sites. The current densities were also normalized by the relative electrochemical surface areas (jECSA) (Figure S9). As indicated, Ce15-Co3O4 has the highest jECSA. Especially, at an overpotential of 420 mV, the jECSA of Ce15-Co3O4 is 6.6 and 3.8 times higher than that of pristine Co3O4 and Ce10-Co3O4, respectively, suggesting that the strain results in the improvement of intrinsic catalytic activity. Moreover, Ce15-Co3O4 has the lowest charge transfer resistance, enhanced charge transfer ability, and accelerated reaction kinetics (Figure 3e). The ability to operate non-noble metal-based catalysts in acidic media for long periods of time is an important challenge and indicator for the wide application of OER catalysts. As shown in Figure 3f, it can be seen that Ce15-Co3O4 can run continuously for 25 h with a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and the potential remains basically unchanged. In contrast to Co3O4, after continuous operation for about 2 h, the voltage continues to increase. After the stability test, there were no morphological changes and Ce aggregations for Ce15-Co3O4 (Figure",

As shown in Figure 3f, it can be seen that Ce15-Co3O4 can run continuously for 25 h with a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and the potential remains basically unchanged. In contrast to Co3O4, after continuous operation for about 2 h, the voltage continues to increase. After the stability test, there were no morphological changes and Ce aggregations for Ce15-Co3O4 (Figure S10). The sample also shows no valence states and structural changes from XPS and XRD measurements (Figures S11–S13).\nIn order to assess the effect of Ce modulating CoO6 chemical environment on OER activity using DFT, we first built structural models by replacing CoO6 octahedron with CeO6 (insert image in Figure 4). The CeO6 octahedron is surrounded by CoOx/MnOx units. Thus, Ce is present in the form of a Ce single atom. According to symmetry conservation rules, among these orbitals, dxy and dz2 interact with the px, py, and pz + s orbitals of *OH, and other interactions are neglectable. Projected density of states (PDOS) (Figure 4a) of the dxy and dz2 orbitals of these materials show that Ce incorporation results in the downshift of dxy and dz2 toward Fermi level, providing enough valence electrons for OER. We further investigated by analyzing the d-band center (εd) and the p-band center (εp) from the PDOS of d, p-bands. The εd and εp values of Co3O4 are −1.234 and −2.907 eV, respectively. While the εd and εp for Ce-doped Co3O4 are −3.383 and −4.944 eV, respectively. The corresponding gaps for d-p band centers are 1.673 and 1.561 eV, for Co3O4, and Ce-doped Co3O4, respectively. Decreased gap suggests higher O 2p character, which can induce higher oxidative activity. (34,35) Moreover, Figure 4b shows that generation of oxygen from OOH*, which is considered the rate-determining step (RDS), exhibits an energy barrier of 2.00 eV for pristine Co3O4 (Figure 4b). The RDS of Ce-doped Co3O4 shows a decreased energy barrier of 1.67 eV. In addition, Ce-doped Co3O4 also shows a decreased energy barrier of OH* production, which is consistent with experimental observation, i.e., the decreased onset potential.\nFigure 4\nFigure 4.

Among them, Ce15-Co3O4 has more active sites and shows better intrinsic catalytic activity and faster electron transfer in acidic media. This excellent catalytic activity and stability of OER can be attributed to the enhanced charge transfer and improved electronic structure induced by Ce SA incorporation. Therefore, in this work, the Ce SA-doped Co3O4 nanosheet significantly improves the activity and durability of the catalyst, providing a new strategy for the design of advanced non-noble metal monatomic catalysts in acidic media.\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c03592.\nAdditional SEM images, Raman spectra, HAADF-STEM images, XPS and XRD patterns, ICP-MS results, and comparison on photocatalytic activity with the-state-of-the-art photocatalysts (PDF)\nic3c03592_si_001.pdf (1.33 MB)\nTerms & Conditions\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.
