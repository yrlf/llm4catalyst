Acid-treated MWCNTs and graphite oxide were doped using biuret, carbohydrazide and semicarbazide hydrochloride as the nitrogen precursors. The reactants were mixed with carbon nanomaterials and pyrolysed in an inert atmosphere at 800 °C. Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterise the surface morphology of catalysts and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface content of the catalysts. XPS revealed different contents of nitrogen gained by using different nitrogen precursors, which were tied to electrochemical activities observed in this work by using the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method. The catalysts revealed high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity even at low loadings and excellent stability over 1000 potential cycles. This indicates their applicability as cathode materials in alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells.\nSubstituting fossil fuels with a sustainable and renewable source of power is one of the key problems in today's society. Traditionally, fuels such as gasoline and diesel are used for automotive purposes, but such engines have low efficiencies and produce unwanted greenhouse gases. Among the promising substitutes for these fuels are hydrogen or methanol, which are converted to electrical energy using fuel cells\n[1]\n. The main obstacle to further development of low-temperature fuel cells is the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode side of the fuel cell\n[2]\n,\n[3]\n. The ORR can occur either by 2- or 4-electron pathway\n[4]\n, of which the latter is desired for fuel cell usage. To improve the ORR kinetics on the cathode of fuel cells, precious-metal catalysts, mainly carbon-supported platinum\n[5]\n,\n[6]\n,\n[7]\nor its alloys\n[8]\nhave been employed, because platinum is a highly active catalyst to facilitate the 4-electron pathway of oxygen reduction. However, platinum is scarce and not available in the amounts needed for the automotive industry. As an alternative, cheap and abundant materials have been used to prepare electrocatalysts with high activity towards the ORR\n[9]\n,\n[10]\n,\n[11]\n.\nVarious carbon materials have been used as a starting material to produce electrocatalysts for ORR, such as mesoporous carbon\n[12]\n,\n[13]\n,\n[14]\n, carbon aerogels\n[15]\n,\n[16]\nand xerogels\n[17]\n, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)\n[18]\n,\n[19]\n,\n[20]\n, graphene\n[21]\n,\n[22]\n,\n[23]\nor their composite materials\n[24]\n,\n[25]\n,\n[26]\n,\n[27]\n,\n[28]\n,\n[29]\n,\n[30]\n,\n[31]\n. All these carbon nanomaterials have some common properties, such as high specific surface area, electrical conductivity, chemical stability and good porosity, which makes them good catalyst supports. The porous structure helps with the mass transfer, large surface area is favourable for the creation of a higher number of active sites, electrical conductivity helps to transport electrons needed for O2 reduction on these active sites and since the materials are also chemically stable, they usually have a long lifetime.\nHowever, since bare carbon nanomaterials are not highly active and mostly catalyse a two-electron reduction of oxygen\n[32]\n,\n[33]\n,\n[34]\n, they need to be modified to achieve efficient catalysts. One way for doing this is to dope",

One way for doing this is to dope carbon nanomaterials with heteroatoms, such as nitrogen\n[12]\n,\n[14]\n,\n[18]\n,\n[19]\n,\n[20]\n,\n[21]\n,\n[22]\n,\n[23]\n,\n[28]\n,\n[29]\n,\n[30]\n,\n[31]\n,\n[35]\n,\n[36]\n,\n[37]\n. When nitrogen is substituted to the carbon lattice, the carbon π electrons are conjugated to the lone pair of the N atom\n[36]\n,\n[38]\n. This means that nitrogen can donate electrons onto the conjugated orbital and increase the electron-donor properties of the material\n[39]\n. The carbon orbital can then donate electrons to the π* orbital of O2 molecule, which eases the splitting of the O–O bond and thus increases the ORR activity\n[24]\n. Nitrogen species in the carbon lattice also facilitate O2 adsorption on the carbon material\n[11]\n.\nThe effects of nitrogen doping can vary. The two most important factors are the amount of nitrogen doped into the carbon material and also the types of nitrogen present\n[40]\n. Nitrogen can form four types of groups when doped into carbon: pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N (quaternary N), and pyridinic N+–O−. Among these, pyridinic N and graphitic N are typically considered as the active groups for ORR in alkaline medium, while pyrrolic N and pyridinic N-oxide are stated to be inactive\n[11]\n,\n[41]\n,\n[42]\n. It has also been recently suggested that graphitic nitrogen can be divided into two subtypes of nitrogen according to its placement in the carbon lattice with the different types having different activities for ORR\n[43]\n,\n[44]\n. However, since there has not yet been demonstrated a way to achieve only a single type of nitrogen species on a catalyst, there is no way to properly determine the activity of each group and thereby there are controversial studies which assert pyrrolic N to be active instead\n[45]\n,\n[46]\nand pyridinic N to catalyse the 2-electron reduction of oxygen\n[47]\n. Surface nitrogen contents have been shown to increase the ORR activity in both acidic\n[48]\n,\n[49]\nand alkaline conditions\n[49]\n,\n[50]\n, as the number of active sites on the surface is proportional to the amount of nitrogen.\nA wide range of methods have been harnessed to obtain nitrogen-doped carbon materials, for example doping directly during synthesis via arc-discharge\n[19]\nor chemical vapour deposition (CVD)\n[20]\n,\n[43]\n,\n[51]\nand the so called post-treatment methods, such as treatment of existing carbon materials with NH3\n[52]\n,\n[53]\n,\n[54]\n,\n[55]\nor pyrolysis in the presence of a nitrogen precursor\n[18]\n,\n[23]\n,\n[25]\n,\n[56]\n,\n[57]\n,\n[58]\n,\n[59]\n. Compared to the other synthesis methods, pyrolysis of a carbon material-nitrogen precursor mixture, has been found to be a cost effective and quick method, granted that the materials used are cheap and contain a large quantity of nitrogen\n[60]\n,\n[61]\n. For this purpose, a number of organic compounds have been used: pyridine\n[31]\n, melamine\n[57]\n,\n[62]\n, polyaniline\n[63]\n, dicyandiamide (DCDA)\n[23]\n,\n[25]\n, urea and its derivatives\n[37]\n,\n[64]\n.\nWe have recently studied post-treatment doping using urea and DCDA as nitrogen",

In this work, we show a quick and easy one-step synthesis method of N-doped nanocarbons using graphene and MWCNTs as carbon base materials and different nitrogen-containing substances to obtain electrocatalytically active composite catalysts for ORR. All the nitrogen precursors used (biuret, carbohydrazide and semicarbazide hydrochloride) are derivatives of urea and therefore the main motivation of this research is to compare the electrocatalytic properties of the N-doped composite materials with that of the urea-derived composite studied previously\n[25]\n. The N-doped carbon nanomaterials are physically characterised by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical characterisation of N-doped nanocarbon catalysts was performed using a rotating disk electrode.\nThe graphene oxide (GO) material used in this work was synthesised from graphite powder (Graphite Trading Company) by a modified Hummers' method\n[66]\n,\n[67]\n. Firstly, 50 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and 2.0 g of graphite powder were mixed in a 250 ml beaker at room temperature. Then, the mixture was sonicated for 1 h. Next, sodium nitrate (2.0 g) and potassium permanganate (6.0 g) divided to smaller portions were slowly added into the beaker in a sequence. At the same time the mixture was stirred on a magnetic stirrer. Afterwards, the mixture was heated at 35 °C for 18 h. When the heating was completed, the beaker was put into an ice bath and 80 ml of deionised water was added into the solution. After few minutes, 20 ml of H2O2 (30%, Merck) was added. The mixture was then washed few times with 10% HCl solution and with water on a vacuum filter. Finally, the obtained brown solid was dried in vacuum at 75 °C.\nMulti-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, Nano-Lab, Inc., Brighton, MA, USA) were treated in acids using a previously published procedure\n[68]\n. After the treatment, the nanotubes were sonicated in ethanol until a homogenous dispersion was achieved. GO was weighed and added so that the amount of GO would correspond to the weight of the nanotubes. Then either biuret, carbohydrazide or semicarbazide hydrochloride as nitrogen precursors (see\nScheme 1\nfor chemical structures of these compounds) and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as a dispersing agent were added. In what follows, these catalyst materials are designated as NG/NCNT-BR, NG/NCNT-CH and NG/NCNT-SC accordingly. The amount of nitrogen precursor was 20 times that of carbon nanomaterial, similarly to our previous studies\n[23]\n,\n[25]\n. The final mixture was further sonicated for 2 h and then dried at 75 °C in vacuum. The material was gathered into a quartz boat and pyrolysed in flowing argon atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. After that the furnace was slowly cooled to room temperature and the product was collected and weighed.\nScheme 1. Chemical structures of (a) biuret, (b) carbohydrazide and (c) semicarbazide used as nitrogen precursors.\nHelios TM NanoLab 600 (FEI) was used to provide scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of catalysts. Suspension of the catalyst in ethanol was pipetted onto cleaned glassy carbon (GC) disk, which served as the substrate material. Different areas of the sample were observed to obtain information about its average characteristics and higher magnified micrographs were taken to investigate the placement of nanotubes and graphene sheets.\nTo analyse the surface composition of N-doped catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used.

Cleaned Si wafer pieces (1.1 × 1.1 cm) served as the substrate material and composite material suspensions in ethanol (3 mg ml−1) were pipetted onto the Si plate. The N-doped carbon nanomaterial coated Si plates were placed into an oven at 80 °C for solvent evaporation. SCIENTA SES-100 spectrometer was employed to carry out the XPS analysis. The catalysts were examined with a non-monochromatic twin anode X-ray tube (XR3E2), whereas characteristic energies were 1253.6 eV (Mg Kα1,2, FWHM 0.68 eV) and 1486.6 eV (Al Kα1,2, FWHM 0.83 eV). The pressure in the analysis chamber was below 10−9 Torr and 300 W source power was used. The survey scan was collected using following parameters: energy range = 800–0 eV, pass energy = 200 eV, step size = 0.5 eV. Following parameters for the high resolution N1s region scan were used: energy range = 408–392 eV, pass energy = 200 eV and step size = 0.1 eV.\nThe rotating disk electrode (RDE) method was used to perform the oxygen reduction measurements. The electrode rotation rate (ω) was varied from 360 to 4600 rpm. The RDE was equipped with CTV101 speed control unit and EDI101 rotator (Radiometer). Electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature (23 ± 1 °C) in 0.1 M KOH solution (p.a. quality, Merck) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. For electrochemical measurements the solutions were saturated with O2 (99.999%, AGA) or Ar (99.999%, AGA). During the experiments the gas flow was maintained over the solution. Saturated calomel electrode (SCE) served as a reference electrode and all the potentials are referred to this electrode. Pt foil served as a counter electrode and was separated from the solution with a glass frit. The potential was applied to electrodes using Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat PGSTAT30 (Eco Chemie B.V., The Netherlands) and General Purpose Electrochemical System (GPES) software was used to control the experiments.\nGC disk electrodes were used as a substrate material. GC disks (GC-20SS, Tokai Carbon) with geometric area (A) of 0.2 cm2 were pressed into a Teflon holder and the electrodes were polished to a mirror finish with 1 and 0.3 μm alumina slurries (Buehler). After polishing, the electrodes were sonicated in 2-propanol and Milli-Q water for 5 min. The GC disk electrodes were modified with composite material suspensions in ethanol (1 mg ml−1) containing 0.3% Tokuyama OH− ionomer AS-04 (Tokuyama Corporation, Japan). The suspensions were sonicated for 1 h prior electrode modification. After that a 20 μl aliquot of the suspension was pipetted onto the GC surface and was allowed to dry in air. Care was taken to cover the surface of GC uniformly with catalyst layer. The composite catalyst loading was 0.1 mg cm−2.\nFor comparison purposes the reduction of oxygen was also studied on Pt/C catalysts deposited on GC. The commercial 20 wt.% Pt catalyst supported on Vulcan XC-72 carbon was purchased from E-TEK, Inc. (Framingham, MA, USA) and dispersed in ethanol (1 mg catalyst ml−1) in presence of Tokuyama AS-04 OH− ionomer. The Pt loading was 20 μg cm−2. To study the durability of composite catalyst, the stability tests were carried out in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. All together 1000 potential cycles were applied at a scan rate (ν) of 100 mV s−1. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were measured after each 100 cycles. The catalyst stability was also tested in the RDE mode using a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 at 960 rpm.\nThe surface morphology of the catalyst materials deposited on a GC electrode substrate was studied using scanning electron microscopy.\nFig. 1\nis a SEM micrograph of a characteristic area of the material doped",

Typical crumpled graphene sheet morphology can be seen, as well as bundles of carbon nanotubes placed between and on the sheets. This type of placement prevents the restacking of graphene sheets, which is one of the main problems for catalysts using solely graphene as the carbon base material. Restacking inhibits mass transfer and thus less oxygen can reach the electrocatalytically active sites, reducing the overall ORR activity\n[28]\n. This surface morphology is typical for all three composite catalysts studied.\nFig. 1. SEM image of NG/NCNT-BR material.\nXPS measurements were carried out to determine the content and type of the surface nitrogen species. As shown in\nFig. 2\na–c, three distinct XPS peaks can be observed in the survey spectra. The peaks at 284.8, 532.1 and 400 eV denote the binding energies of C1s, O1s and N1s, respectively. According to literature the majority of the oxygen surface groups are removed from carbon at higher pyrolysis temperatures\n[69]\n,\n[70]\n. However for our catalyst materials some oxygen is still detectable but because of the close binding energies of the different oxygen-containing surface groups, it is rather hard to identify the exact nature of these oxygen functionalities. Previous investigations have shown that carboxyl and quinone groups are present on the surface of carbon nanomaterials\n[71]\n,\n[72]\n. The presence of N1s peak around 400 eV indicates the successful incorporation of nitrogen atoms into graphene/CNT material. The types of nitrogen species were identified by curve-fitting. The peaks in the high resolution N1s spectra in\nFig. 2\nd–f, can be deconvoluted into four components: pyridine-N-oxide (404.1 eV)\n[73]\n, quaternary N (401.1 eV), pyrrolic N (400.1 eV) and pyridinic N (398.1 eV). The quaternary nitrogen corresponds to N atoms that are linked with three carbon atoms in graphene basal plane\n[62]\n,\n[74]\n, replacing the C atoms in graphene hexagonal ring. Pyrrolic N occurs in five-member ring\n[73]\n,\n[74]\nand pyridinic N occurs in six-member ring\n[39]\n,\n[48]\n,\n[73]\n,\n[74]\n. The total nitrogen content in NG/NCNT-BR, NG/NCNT-CH and NG/NCNT-SC were 2.8, 2.5 and 1.7 at.%, respectively. The dominant nitrogen species was pyridinic N (NG/NCNT-BR 46%, NG/NCNT-CH 39% and NG/NCNT-SC 35%), also the relative content of pyrrolic N was high (NG/NCNT-BR 24%, NG/NCNT-CH 26% and NG/NCNT-SC 32%), the amount of quaternary N (NG/NCNT-BR 21%, NG/NCNT-CH 17% and NG/NCNT-SC 16%) and pyridine-N-oxide (NG/NCNT-BR 10%, NG/NCNT-CH 17% and NG/NCNT-SC 17%) was smaller. Interestingly, the relative amount of both catalytically active species, quaternary N and pyridinic N remains approximately the same for all the N-doped composite materials studied ranging from 51 to 67%, but the total content of nitrogen differs considerably ranging from 1.7 to 2.8 at.%. The XPS analysis showed clearly that nitrogen doping was successful and four different types of nitrogen species were present on the surface of carbon nanomaterials, from which the main component is pyridinic nitrogen.\nFig. 2. XPS survey spectra (a–c) and N1s spectra (d–f) for NG/NCNT-BR, NG/NCNT-CH and NG/NCNT-SC samples, respectively.\nThe rotating disk electrode method was utilised to study the electrochemical properties of the N-doped composite materials",

XPS survey spectra (a–c) and N1s spectra (d–f) for NG/NCNT-BR, NG/NCNT-CH and NG/NCNT-SC samples, respectively.\nThe rotating disk electrode method was utilised to study the electrochemical properties of the N-doped composite materials in alkaline conditions. The undoped material was characterised first to get a starting point for further RDE analysis.\nFig. 3\na shows the ORR polarisation curves for undoped GO/MWCNT heat-treated at 800 °C for 2 h. The onset potential for ORR is at ca. −0.2 V vs SCE with a second wave starting at approximately −0.8 V, which can be attributed to the quinone-type groups\n[33]\non the surface of GO/MWCNT and which are not fully removed in the pyrolysis step. The overall electrocatalytic activity of the base material is thus mediocre. When semicarbazide is used to dope the composite material with nitrogen, there is a positive shift in the onset potential as shown in\nFig. 3\nb. The onset potential for this material was determined as −0.15 V and as can be seen, the reduction current values at respective electrode potentials and rotation rates are also noticeably higher, indicating an increase in electrocatalytic activity due to nitrogen doping. It has been proposed that N atoms can create a high positive charge on the neighbouring carbon atoms and thus change the adsorption mode of the O2 molecule from end-on adsorption to side-on adsorption\n[11]\nin addition to weakening of the O–O bond. These factors are probably responsible for higher ORR activity. However, the polarisation curve has still two waves and current plateaus are not formed, which indicates that the process is limited by both diffusion and the kinetics of the reaction in a large potential range. Using carbohydrazide as nitrogen precursor, the onset potential stays approximately at −0.15 V vs SCE, but the ORR process is clearly diffusion-limited at higher negative potentials, showing current plateaus and higher reduction current values than those of the semicarbazide-derived counterpart (\nFig. 3\nb). Since there is no way to quantitatively measure the number of active sites on this type of catalyst materials, the reason for the increase in electrocatalytic activity is still somewhat unclear. However, Yasuda et al. have recently synthesised catalysts containing 90% pyridinic N, which showed excellent ORR activity and it has been concluded that the pyridinic nitrogen species are the main active site for O2 reduction\n[75]\n. Pyridinic N is also more exposed as it sits at the edge of the carbon plane and thus can be more available for O2 molecules\n[76]\n. This is in accordance with our results, as NG/NCNT-CH contains more pyridinic N than NG/NCNT-SC. Also, the total nitrogen content is 1.4 times lower in the catalyst derived from semicarbazide, noting that a larger amount of nitrogen species on the surface increases the activity of the material. The amount of graphitic N is nearly the same in both materials, so it is rather hard to make a statement on its activity according to these data. We have previously concluded that graphitic N can have an effect on the limiting reduction current of the materials\n[25]\nand this may well be the case here, but as Sharifi et al. have suggested, graphitic N can be divided into two subdivisions, one of which has a larger effect on the activity of the material\n[43]\n. The most active material was obtained using biuret as a nitrogen precursor. This material showed an onset potential of about −0.12 V vs SCE and clear reduction current plateaus commenced at the most positive potentials of these N-doped composite materials studied, noting diffusion-limited process. The peak at around −0.2 V vs SCE shown at lower rotation speeds is due to the reduction of oxygen trapped in the inner structures of the catalyst, indicating that this catalyst has a complex structure with a high specific surface area. The high activity of this catalyst is again most likely caused by a larger amount of pyridinic N groups in the material. NG/NCNT-BR also contains the least pyrrolic N, which is known to have lower activity towards the ORR\n[58]\nand pyridine-N-oxide species, which is known to be inactive for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis\n[76",

The total nitrogen content is also slightly higher in NG/NCNT-BR than the other catalysts, but as we have shown in our previous work\n[23]\n,\n[25]\nand this has been also shown in the literature\n[48]\n, increasing the total nitrogen content is only beneficial to some limit. As the activity of NG/NCNT-BR is somewhat greater than that of our previously studied materials, among which the best electrocatalyst had a 4 at.% of total nitrogen and a 50% pyridinic N content\n[25]\n, it is probable that not only does the amount of pyridinic N matter, but also the combination of multiple nitrogen species. This is in accordance with Okamoto's work, who found that a CC bond next to two nitrogen atoms is ideal for oxygen reduction as predicted by computational methods\n[78]\n. It is worth noting that the NG/NCNT catalysts synthesised in this work showed good ORR performance at a catalyst loading of 100 μg cm−2, while the loading used in the literature usually far exceeds this\n[20]\n,\n[29]\n,\n[79]\n.\nFig. 3.

The n value was close to 2 at E > −0.8 V, but as the potential decreased and the second wave began on the polarisation curve, the value of n increased to 3. This shows that the second wave is due to the partial reduction of the peroxide formed by the 2-electron process. Extrapolation of the K–L lines yields a considerable intercept at −1.2 V vs SCE, which is further evidence that the overall O2 reduction process is under the mixed kinetic-diffusion control even at these high negative potentials.\nFig. 4.

Data derived from\nFig. 3\n.\nThe N-doped composite materials synthesised with carbohydrazide and biuret as the nitrogen precursor showed a value of n close to 4 on all studied potentials (\nFig. 4\nc, d), meaning that these catalysts produce little to no hydrogen peroxide and are highly active for ORR. It has also been found in the literature that the pyridinic N groups, which were the dominant species in NG/NCNT-BR and NG/NCNT-CH catalyse the four-electron reduction of O2\n[75]\n. The NG/NCNT-SC catalyst also had a large amount of pyridinic N, but the n value was slightly lower than four (\nFig. 4\nb). This can again be evidence of the necessity of multiple adjacent nitrogen species. By extrapolating the K–L lines the intercept on the y-axis is close to zero, meaning that the ORR process is entirely under diffusion control. These materials are good candidates for usage as cathode catalysts in alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells.\nFig. 5\ncompares the RDE results for all three synthesised N-doped nanocarbon materials along with undoped GO/MWCNT and commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C to better express the activity trends of these catalysts. The onset potential for Pt/C catalyst is about 50 mV higher, but the half-wave potential of O2 reduction for NG/NCNT-CH and NG/NCNT-BR is rather close to that of the Pt/C catalyst. At more negative potentials the reduction current of NG/NCNT-CH and especially NG/NCNT-BR exceeds that of Pt/C, which is further evidence of their high electrocatalytic activity for ORR and indicates the presence of a large amount of active sites on these materials.\nFig. 5. Comparison of RDE results of oxygen reduction on bare GC, GO/MWCNT, NG/NCNT-SC, NG/NCNT-CH, NG/NCNT-BR and Pt/C modified GC electrodes in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. ν = 10 mV s−1, ω = 1900 rpm.\nThe durability of the N-doped composite catalysts was also studied using the RDE technique and the results are shown in\nFig. 6\n. The catalyst was cycled between 0 and −1.2 V vs SCE for 1000 potential cycles. After every 100 cycles an LSV curve and RDE polarisation curve were recorded. The LSV peak current values were nearly identical during the whole test and the ORR polarization curves showed minimal activity loss, indicating that these materials have excellent stability in alkaline media. This is similar to our previously researched doped nanocarbon catalysts, which have been successfully tested in a direct methanol fuel cell\n[27]\n.\nFig. 6.

The surface morphology of these composites was studied using SEM and the surface composition was analysed by XPS. Four types of nitrogen species were identified in the catalyst, of which pyridinic N made up the largest amount on all catalyst materials. Oxygen reduction in 0.1 M KOH was investigated on GC electrodes modified with N-doped composite catalysts using the RDE method. A larger amount of total surface nitrogen and pyridinic N groups were identified as the reasons for higher ORR activity of the doped catalysts. The comparison with undoped composite material and Pt/C catalyst revealed that the increase in activity is very notable and rivals that of commercial Pt/C. The stability of the catalysts was also studied and found to be excellent over 1000 potential cycles. These catalysts are interesting candidates for practical application as cathode materials in alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells.\nThis research was financially supported by institutional research funding (IUT20-16) by the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research",
