Introducing conductive carbon substrates can enhance the ORR performance of GCN, but until now, none of the carbon-supported GCN catalysts has shown both excellent catalysis selectivity and fast ORR kinetics. Two-dimensional graphene sheets (GSs) may serve as suitable substrates for GCN due to their fast electron collection and transport properties, and their structural similarity to GCN as well. In this work, we present a facile method of producing intercalated GS/GCN composites with hierarchical porosity, which is experimentally achieved for the first time. The ORR activity is optimised by tuning the amount of active sites, electrical conductivity and mass transport. The obtained material possesses 100% catalysis selectivity towards the four-electron pathway, and its ORR activities outperform any other existing GCN-based catalysts. It also shows significantly improved tolerance against methanol and enhanced long-term stability, compared with the commercial platinum-loaded carbon catalysts. Thus it is expected that the hierarchically porous GS/GCN intercalated composite is a promising future ORR catalyst.', 'Introduction': 'It is commonly accepted that introducing nitrogen into a carbon matrix is a key step to synthesize highly active metal-free ORR catalysts.6b Despite the controversy on the exact role of the nitrogen heteroatom in ORR, both quantum mechanical calculations7 and experimental observations8 reveal that incorporation of nitrogen, especially the pyridinic or/and graphitic species, induces a positive charge on the adjacent carbon, which can facilitate oxygen adsorption and subsequently weaken the O–O bond in the adsorbed oxygen molecules. In this regard, graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) – stacked two dimensional (2D) heptazine (C6N7) sheets connected by tertiary amines – may serve as a promising metal-free ORR catalyst owing to its high nitrogen content (60.9 wt% in theory and mainly of pyridinic/graphitic nature) and stable molecular structure.9\\nUnfortunately, the electrocatalytic activity of pristine GCN is restricted by its semi-conductive nature (<10−2 S cm−1), which obstructs electron transfer during the ORR process.10 Thus introducing electron-conductive carbon materials as substrates should be a general strategy to improve the ORR performance of GCN. First-principles studies on the ORR capability of GCN have shown that if sufficient electrons are available in the GCN–O2 system, the ORR could occur via a direct four-electron (4e−) pathway, rather than the two-step two-electron (2e−) pathway for the pristine GCN.11 The first experimental attempt of carbon-supported GCN composites was to mechanically blend GCN with carbon black (CB).12 The GCB/CB composites showed much improved onset potential and reduction current density, compared with pristine GCN, as a result of the increased conductivity and surface area derived from the carbon black support.12 To further clarify the role of substrates, ordered porous carbon materials, such as CMK-3, were then adopted as their morphology and structures were easy to control.11 It was shown that incorporation of GCN into CMK-3 led to a direct 4e− pathway, consistent with the theoretical prediction.11 However, the small mesopores in CMK-3 may not be capable of fast mass exchange during ORR and the catalytic activity of GCN@CMK-3 was thus worse than that of the commercial Pt/C. From this point of view, uniform GCN embedded porous carbon (GCN/C) composites with a tuneable pore size have been prepared.13 The ORR activity of macroporous GCN/C with a pore size of 150 nm was shown superior to that of the mesoporous GCN/C with a pore size of 12 nm obtained via a similar synthesis route. The macroporous GCN/C facilitated the oxygen diffusion, and led to a much smaller Tafel slope value in the high overpotential region than that of the mesoporous sample. However the overall electron transfer number for this macroporous composite was only three, indicating a combined 2e− and 4e− reaction pathway, which was probably due to the low specific surface area and the lack of exposed active sites.13 So far, none of the aforementioned carbon-supported GCN composites can show both fast ORR kinetics and excellent selectivity of 4e− catalysis pathway",

In addition, the layered morphology was unfavourable for ORR due to the limited exposure of active sites and the inefficient mass transport and access.10 Inspired by that, here for the first time, we experimentally synthesized GS/GCN intercalated composites with hierarchical porosity. The ORR activity was first optimised by balancing two intrinsic parameters – active sites and conductivity. After further taking into account of mass transport, the obtained hierarchically porous GS/GCN intercalated composites showed fast reduction kinetics and 100% ORR catalysis selectivity, with better long-term stability and stronger tolerance against methanol than the commercial Pt/C catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, such excellent catalytic activities outperformed any other existing GCN-based ORR catalysts.10–13,16', 'Experimental details': 'Synthesis of GO\\nSynthesis of GCN\\nSynthesis of GSGCN\\nSynthesis of hp-GSGCN_2×\\nElectrochemical measurement\\nCharacterization', 'Results and discussion': 'Chemical constitutions of the intercalated GS/GCN composites are then examined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results (Fig. 2) show that the out-of-plane bending vibration characteristics of heptazine rings20 (∼800 cm−1, highlighted by the ellipse) for GCN are preserved in all GS/GCN composites, while the typical stretching vibration modes of heptazine-derived repeating units20 (∼1200–1650 cm−1, highlighted by the straight lines in the inserted small plot) appear in GSGCN_2×, GSGCN_2.5× and GSGCN_3× but are not evident in GSGCN_1× and GSGCN_1.5×, implying either an incomplete polymerization or partial decomposition of the GCN component for the latter two composites.20c What is more, it is noticed that GO has been successfully reduced to GS via thermal annealing as the non-sp2 carbon bonds (i.e. C–O, CO and O–CO) of GO significantly diminish in all GS/GCN composites21 (highlighted by the straight lines in the main plot), which could be further supported by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results.\\nIt is shown in XPS C1s spectra (Fig. 3a) that the intensities of the C–O bond (∼286.5 eV) and the CO bond (∼288 eV) are largely reduced in GS and GS/GCN composites and the atomic ratio of Csp2/Csp3 increases from 0.9 for GO to 2.7 for GS.22 Also the N–CN bond (∼288.3 eV) from GCN22 could hardly been observed in GSGCN_1× and GSGCN_1.5×, in line with the FTIR results. It is worth noting that the C–C bond (∼284.7 eV in GS/GCN)22 and the N–CN bond (∼288.1 eV in GS/GCN, if applicable) of GS/GCN composites show a right/left shift of ca.",

It is worth noting that the C–C bond (∼284.7 eV in GS/GCN)22 and the N–CN bond (∼288.1 eV in GS/GCN, if applicable) of GS/GCN composites show a right/left shift of ca. 0.1 eV compared with that of the pure GS and GCN respectively (highlighted by the dashed lines in Fig. 3a), which should be attributed to the strong electron transfer between the intercalated GS/GCN interfaces.14 The relative ratios of pyridinic nitrogen bonding (∼399 eV)22d derived from XPS N1s spectra for the GSGCN_1× and GSGCN_1.5× are much lower than that of pure GCN (Fig. 3b), confirming the incomplete polymerization or partial decomposition of GCN discovered in the FTIR.\\nThe residual mass of the GS/GCN composites after thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Fig. 4a) could be used to estimate the mixing ratio of GS/GCN in the composites23 since GCN has almost completely decomposed after heating at 800 °C while no significant weight change could be detected for GS. The decrease of the GS content in the composites, from GSGCN_1× to GSGCN_3×, is in agreement with the increasing nitrogen content derived from XPS (Fig. 4b). Note that the intercalation of GCN into the GS layer lowers the GCN decomposition temperature of ca. 30 °C (Fig. 4a), indicating that this intercalated hybrid structure decreases the decomposition temperature of GCN. Hence the lack of GCN pattern in GSGCN_1× and GSGCN_1.5× should be attributed to the partial decomposition of GCN.\\nThe electrocatalytic behaviours of intercalated GS/GCN composites are examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the current density presented here equals the measured current divided by the geometric surface area of the GC electrode. As shown in Fig. 5 that the ORR performances of all the GS/GCN composites with different GCN ratios are superior to that of pure GCN, in terms of both onset/peak reduction potential and current density. More importantly, as the GCN content in the composites increases initially, from GSGCN_1× to GSGCN_2×, the reduction current density increases while the onset/peak reduction potential remains the same; but when the GCN content further increases, from GSGCN_2× to GSGCN_3×, both the reduction current density and potential decrease considerably and gradually show a pattern similar to that of pure GCN. Such phenomena could also be confirmed by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurement (Fig. S3†).\\nTo explain the above observations on the ORR properties of GS/GCN intercalated composites, both structural characteristics and chemical composition need to be considered. Particularly the BET SSA (m2 g−1) and total nitrogen content from XPS (atom%) should be taken into account, as the surface nitrogen heteroatom is the origin of ORR catalytic activity.6a Here we introduce a new parameter called ‘effective-SSA’ (E-SSA), which is defined as the product of SSA and nitrogen content. In this sense, E-SSA could represent the amount of active sites, and E-SSA normalized peak reduction current thus represents the conductivity, assuming no major difference in the mass transport capability for GS/GCN composites as they all possess layered structures, a similar macro-morphology. It is shown in Fig. 6, when the GCN content in the composites is low, the E-SSA normalized current is almost constant, indicating sufficient conductivity supplied by the intercalated GS. As a result, the ORR performances, similar reduction potential but increasing current density from GSGCN_1× to GSGCN_2×, are dependent on the amount of active sites. However when the GCN content is in excess, though the E-SSA of GSGCN_2.5× and GSGCN_3× is similar to that of GSGCN_2×, the E-SSA normalized current decreases significantly, in accordance with the rapid decline in both reduction potential and peak current density. This suggests that the amount of GS in the composites no longer affords to provide enough conductivity and the ORR activity turns into conductivity dependent",

However when the GCN content is in excess, though the E-SSA of GSGCN_2.5× and GSGCN_3× is similar to that of GSGCN_2×, the E-SSA normalized current decreases significantly, in accordance with the rapid decline in both reduction potential and peak current density. This suggests that the amount of GS in the composites no longer affords to provide enough conductivity and the ORR activity turns into conductivity dependent. Accordingly, GSGCN_2× shows the best ORR performance among all five GS/GCN intercalated composites because it possesses the largest amount of active sites while retains sufficient conductivity. The increase in electrical conductivity, which is led by the intercalation of GS into GCN layers, is one of the key requirements for the improved ORR activities. Such an enhancement can be confirmed by the four-probe conductivity measurement (Table S1†). Typically, the powder conductivity for GCN is under the detection limitation of the instrument, and thus must be smaller than 10−2 S cm−1, similar to the previous report.10 For GS/GCN intercalated composites, the conductivity is about 0.5–4.5 S cm−1, i.e. 3.06 S cm−1 for GSGCN_2×, at least two magnitudes greater than that of pristine GCN.\\nMass transport is another crucial factor for ORR besides active sites and electrical conductivity.24 Though macropores are capable of fast oxygen exchange during ORR, the relatively low surface area leads to a lack of exposed active sites.13,25 It is thus expected that hierarchical porosity with combined macropores and mesopores may solve the dilemma of both high accessibility and high surface area, as macropores can promise efficient mass transport while mesopores offer sufficient accessible active sites. Here we demonstrate that such a hierarchically porous GS/GCN intercalated composite (hp-GSGCN_2×) can be easily fabricated by the addition of excess silica nanospheres before the polymerization of GCN. The macroporosity of the obtained hp-GSGCN_2× is confirmed by SEM (Fig. 7a) and the mesopores with an average size close to the diameter of individual silica sphere template (ca. 10 nm) are shown in a HRTEM image (Fig. 7b). Note that the interlayer spacing of hp-GSGCN_2× (∼0.33 nm, as shown in the HRTEM image) is close to that of GSGCN_2×, which means that the hp-GSGCN_2× also retains the intercalated structure. The XPS patterns of hp-GSGCN_2× are similar to those of GSGCN_2× with a slight decrease in nitrogen content, but the SSA of hp-GSGCN_2× is ∼50% greater than that of GSGCN_2× (Fig. S2†), making the overall E-SSA roughly 30% higher.\\nThe ORR activities of hp-GSGCN_2× are first assessed by CV. As shown in Fig. 8a, the peak current density of hp-GSGCN_2× is almost 1.5 times higher than that of GSGCN_2× and the onset/peak reduction potential also increases by ∼30 mV, which is further confirmed by LSV (Fig. 8b and S4†). Surprisingly, though the onset reduction potential of hp-GSGCN_2× is still lower than that of Pt/C, the current density surpasses Pt/C at a potential of only −0.24 V vs. Ag/AgCl and the half wave potential is only 90 mV lower. The electron transfer numbers for GSGCN_2× and hp-GSGCN_2× are calculated by the Koutecky–Levich equation:3a\\n\\nSince safety is the first priority for the widespread application of electric vehicles,26 the tolerance against the methanol crossover effect should be of particular importance to the direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), and so as the long-term durability. The methanol tolerance is evaluated by the current–time response at −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Oxygen is purged into the electrolyte from 500 s and 3 M methanol is added after 3500 s. It is shown in Fig. 9a that the ORR of Pt/C switches to a methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) after the addition of 3 M methanol, as indicated by the shift to a positive current density;3b however the OR",

The long-term durability of hp-GSGCN_2× and commercial Pt/C is also assessed through the chronoamperometric response at −0.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The ten-hour test only causes a slight activity loss for hp-GSGCN_2×, whereas Pt/C loses nearly 40% of its initial activity. These two measurements confirm that the hp-GSGCN_2× in this work is much more stable in the alkaline electrolyte and against the methanol cross-over effect, compared with the commercial Pt/C.', 'Conclusions': '', 'Acknowledgements': '(a) B.
