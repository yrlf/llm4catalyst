  "0": "Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an essential component in energy conversion and storage systems, especially in alkaline fuel cells and metal-air batteries. (1−3) These devices are, however, restricted in efficiency by the inherently sluggish kinetics of ORR that occurs at the cathode and involves multistep electron transfer, which also poses significant hurdles for developing ORR catalysts. Although platinum-group metals (PGMs) are effective catalysts to promote the ORR, their distinct inferiority of high cost and scarcity have spurred considerable searches for more efficient and durable ORR alternatives. (4−7)\nRecently, single-atom catalysts (SACs), where transition-metal single atoms coordinated with nitrogen (MNx) embedded in a carbon matrix (MNC), have captured surging attention, owing to their high activity derived from uniform and tunable metal active center sites and optimal atom utilization. (8−10) The carbon matrix with excellent conductivity and hierarchical porosity also offers numerous channels in boosting electron and mass transfer simultaneously. (11−13) Despite this, their catalytic performance is by far unsatisfactory, partly ascribed to their inaccessible active sites, poor conductivity, and insufficient interfacial contacts. As a result, an optimal structural configuration of the SACs, with more accessible active moieties and excellent mass transport capacities, is critical to achieving ORR activity and stability comparable to those of PGM catalysts.\nOn the other hand, the local electronic environment around the active sites of MNC is deemed to act pivotally to modulate the ORR performance. Varying the surrounding atoms of the active sites, utilizing heteroatoms (e.g., N, S, B, Cl and P, etc.), has been acknowledged as a powerful strategy for enhancing the intrinsic ORR performance by means of optimizing their electron distribution and atom coordination environment, (14−18) especially promising for updating single-atom dispersed FeNC systems. For instance, classic N-doping in the first coordination shell of the Fe center (e.g., Fe–N4) has been evidenced to be a feasible alternative to Pt-based catalysts for ORR. (6,19) However, the strong adsorption of oxygen on the active Fe–N4 site hinders the following hydrogenation of the oxygen, thus restraining the efficiency of the overall ORR. (20,21) Incorporating a secondary heteroatom into the second coordination shell of the Fe–N4 site could modulate the surface polarity as well as the electronic environment of the site, favoring the reaction kinetics and further elevating the ORR activity. (14,22−25) Therefore, rational electronic modulation of the active site coupled with optimal structural design synchronously is quite appealing.\nPhosphorus (P) is a well-known electron donor that can be incorporated into a carbon substrate to tune the electronic structure of individual metal sites via its 3p lone-pair electrons, thus tailoring their microchemical coordination environment. (11,26−29) Recent studies have demonstrated that the P heteroatom of SACs can boost catalytic center activity via a near-range or long-range coordination interaction induced by the varied electronegativities or electronic coordination environments. (26,30−34) For example, Yuan et al. introduced P into FeNC catalysts to create the FeN3P active sites to improve their ORR activity through near-range coordination synergy. (26) Sun et al. involved P into Fe-SAC to lower the energy barrier for enabling enhanced CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) by generating a long-range electron localization to FeN4 sites. (30) Nonetheless, it is still unclear how P is chemically bonded in carbon materials, since P can be easily oxidized into the P–O species in the heteroatom doping process. (16,35) For this reason, the increased catalytic activity on the metal center cannot be attributed exclusively to the P; an insight into the role of the P–O bond may benefit the rational creation of a high-performance ORR catalyst. However, few reports explicate the nature of how a single P–O bond with the near- and long-range arrangements in SACs affects the activity of the metal center for ORR.\nHerein, we report a facile gas-steamed metal–organic framework (MOF) route to fabricate a hierarchical porous P-doped single Fe atom catalyst, P–O/FeNC-SAC, mainly in the form of P–O bonds for advancing the ORR. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations uncovered that the doping of the P–O bond, serving as long-range coordination, alters the electronic configuration and charge density distribution of the Fe center, which can greatly enhance the hydrogenation of",

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations uncovered that the doping of the P–O bond, serving as long-range coordination, alters the electronic configuration and charge density distribution of the Fe center, which can greatly enhance the hydrogenation of adsorbed oxygen, resulting in efficient ORR performance. Also, the P–O/FeNC-SAC structure, combining a high specific surface area with hierarchical porosity, can enhance the mass transport of ORR-relevant species and improve the accessibility of active sites, thus speeding up the ORR.\nFigure 1a schematically depicts a three-step procedure for the synthesis of the P–O/FeNC-SACs. (36) Here, PH3 generated by the thermal decomposition of sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2) mainly shows a dual function in generating porosity and introducing P dopant into the carbon matrix (see experimental details in the Supporting Information). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses show that the pristine MIL-101 MOF support with rod-like morphology mainly possesses highly dense narrow pores (Figure 1b,c). As shown in Figure 1d,e, the following synthesis using the MIL-101 MOFs produces noticeably larger interconnected pores with a diameter of tens of nanometers in the P–O/FeNC-SAC, while the rod-like shape is nicely maintained. The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image in Figure 1f displays a number of bright spots (highlighted by circles), which can be assigned to the heavier metal atoms, confirming the atomically dispersed state of the metal sites in this sample. Energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images (Figure 1g) further confirm the uniform distribution of C, N, P, and Fe elements along the carbon support. The TEM observation strongly suggested that the gas-steam process successfully introduces P-doping into porous carbon networks with FeNC single-atom (SA) species. In addition, a P–O/FeNC-SAC* sample was also prepared as a control under the same conditions but in an unsealed crucible for PH3 gas-steam treatment. Interestingly, a porous structure similar to that of the P–O/FeNC-SAC is absent for the P–O/FeNC-SAC* sample (Figure S1).\nFigure 1\nFigure 1. (a) Schematic diagram of the synthetic approach for P–O/FeNC-SAC. (b) SEM and (c) TEM images of the MIL-101 MOFs. (d) SEM, (e) TEM, and (f) HAADF-STEM images of the P–O/FeNC-SAC sample. Bright spots in (f) indicate the single metal atoms (marked by yellow circiles). (g) Dark-field TEM image of the selected area for elemental mapping and corresponding EDS elemental mapping images of C, N, P, and Fe in the P–O/FeNC-SAC sample.\nA series of P–O/FeNC-SAC samples was prepared by varying the mass ratio of NaH2PO2/MIL-101 to be 0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1 during synthesis, expressed as P(x), x = 0, 0.5, 1, and 2; the control sample of P–O/FeNC-SAC* was denoted as P(1)*. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) shows a sharp mass drop at the temperature range of 300–550 °C, indicating a critical parameter to release PH3 gas for fumigating the MIL-101 (Figure S2). (36) The crystallite structure of the P–O/FeNC-SAC samples was then evaluated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy (Figure S3a). Raman spectroscopy was carried out to examine the defect (D) and graphite (G) characteristics in the carbon materials (Figure S3b). To explore the chemical state of the P–O/FeNC-SACs treated by varied NaH2PO2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were performed (Figures S4, S5; Tables S1, S2). The primary peaks of the P 2p spectra can be observed for all the",

To explore the chemical state of the P–O/FeNC-SACs treated by varied NaH2PO2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were performed (Figures S4, S5; Tables S1, S2). The primary peaks of the P 2p spectra can be observed for all the P-doped samples, including the P(1)*, which can be deconvoluted into two bands assigned to the P–O (∼135.6 eV) and P–C (∼133.9 eV) bonds (Figure S5b and Figure S6); the inexistence of the peak corresponding to the Fe–P bond at ∼128.5 eV indicates that P is hardly coordinated with Fe. (26,31)\nTo further delineate the chemical states and surface construction of P–O/FeNC-SAC (sample P(1)), the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements (Figure 2) are conducted to clarify the atomically dispersed local configurations around the Fe atom. Fe–K edge XANES plots of P–O/FeNC-SAC are depicted in Figure 2a, along with those of the standard samples of Fe2O3, Fe foil, and iron phthalocyanine (FePc). A positively charged state of the Fe single-atom centers can be deducted for the P–O/FeNC-SAC sample, as evidenced by the higher near-edge absorption energy position of the Fe K-edge of P–O/FeNC-SAC than that of Fe foil. (37) The absorption maximum for P–O/FeNC-SAC is higher than that for FePc (labeled as A and B, respectively, in Figure 2a), suggesting the main component of pyridinic-type N in P–O/FeNC-SAC. (38,39) Moreover, the Fe–N coordination at the first shell can be explained by the Fourier-transform EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) spectrum of the P–O/FeNC-SAC, which exhibits one dominant peak at ∼1.5 Å, while no Fe–Fe scattering is present at 2.2 Å (Figure 2b), ruling out the possibility of any Fe agglomerates in the sample. The EXAFS results were fitted to probe the coordination environment of Fe in P–O/FeNC-SAC. The fitting results presented in Figure 2c,d, Figure S7, and Table S3 reveal that Fe atoms in the P–O/FeNC-SAC are coordinated with 4 N atoms to form the Fe–N4 structure (see the typical model embedded in Figure 2c). (40,41) The wavelet transform (WT) contour curves of Fe K-edge EXAFS were used to further investigate the local structure of Fe in P–O/FeNC-SAC. One intensity maximum is observed at ∼6.0 Å–1 for the P–O/FeNC-SAC, which corresponds to the Fe–N scattering. In comparison with the WT plots of Fe2O3, FePc, and Fe foil, no intensity maximum associated with the Fe–Fe contribution can be identified (Figure 2e).\nFigure 2\nFigure 2.

We conducted the N2 adsorption/desorption analysis to the P(1)* sample for comparison, which was synthesized in an unsealed crucible during PH3 gas treatment. The pore size distribution and specific surface area of P(1)* are almost similar to those of P(0) of the P-undoped sample (Figure S",

We conducted the N2 adsorption/desorption analysis to the P(1)* sample for comparison, which was synthesized in an unsealed crucible during PH3 gas treatment. The pore size distribution and specific surface area of P(1)* are almost similar to those of P(0) of the P-undoped sample (Figure S9), implying that the PH3 gas treatment in an open environment can only simply dope P into the carbon matrix to form P–O bonds; by stark contrast, such an operation in a confined space leads to the doping and more pores/holes creation simultaneously. Furthermore, the significantly enhanced porosity is beneficial to the adsorption of Fe(phen)32+ complexes for the fabrication of dense Fe–N4 single atom sites, (42,43) which has been verified by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurement with the highest Fe content of 1.17% for P(1) (Table S5).\nRotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) experiments were performed to examine the catalytic performance of the samples. The ORR activities of the P-doped samples showed a dependence on pyrolysis temperature and dosage of P source (Figure S10). For comparison, the activities of the P-undoped sample (P(0), FeNC-SAC), commercial 20 wt % Pt/C (Johnson Matthey), and P–O/NC without Fe and P(1)* catalysts were also assessed. As illustrated in Figure 3a, the P–O/FeNC-SAC exhibits better catalytic performance than the 20 wt % Pt/C and P–O/NC, e.g., half-wave potential: 0.912 V vs 0.864 and 0.735 V, and limiting current density: −5.48 mA cm–2 vs −4.91 and −4.57 mA cm–2 at 0.2 V. The FeNC-SAC and P–O/FeNC-SAC* samples show similar performance as the Pt/C catalyst. Meanwhile, P–O/FeNC-SAC exhibits a higher kinetic current density (Jk, 7.54 mA cm–2 at 0.9 V) than FeNC-SAC (2.03 mA cm–2), Pt/C (1.87 mA cm–2), P–O/FeNC-SAC* (3.35 mA cm–2), and P–O/NC (0.13 mA cm–2) (Figure 3b). As presented in Figure 3c, the corresponding Tafel slope of P–O/FeNC-SAC (68.7 mV decade–1) is also lower than that of other controls. To our knowledge, the P–O/FeNC-SAC performs relatively better ORR activity than other state-of-the-art ORR electrocatalysts in an alkaline electrolyte (Table S6). Hydroperoxide yield (H2O2 %) and the electron transfer number (n) were utilized to determine the ORR route of the P–O/FeNC-SAC; as illustrated in Figure 3d, the H2O2 yield detected upon P–O/FeNC-SAC is fairly low (∼5%), and the n is calculated to be ∼4, indicating an effective four-electron transfer process.\nFigure 3\nFigure 3.

(i) Chronoamperometric responses of P–O/FeNC-SAC, FeNC-SAC, and Pt/C at 0.85 V vs RHE.\nThe electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was determined using double-layer capacitance (Cdl) measurements (Figure S11). In conjunction with the favorable ORR performance in the alkaline medium stated above, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities for P–O/FeNC-SAC were examined, which also showed better performance than those of the IrO2 benchmark catalyst. Detailed discussion about the OER property can be found in Supporting Information and Figure S12.\nIn addition, nitrite poisoning tests were performed on the samples with and without P-doping to quantify the available active sites (see Figure S13a–e for ORR polarization curves). (44) The P(1) sample displays a larger stripping charge than P(0) and other controls prepared using different dosages of NaH2PO2 (as shown in Figure 3e and Figure S13f–h). Based on the stripping charge, the accessible Fe–N4 site density (SD) and actual atomic utilization were evaluated. The calculated SD (up to 26 μmol g–1, 5.91 × 1019 site g–1) and charge value of Fe–N4 in the P(1) sample are obviously higher than those in P(0) (Figure 3e), again suggesting that the PH3 gas-steam fumigation is indeed an effective method to raise the micro/mesoporous surface area to harbor more active sites.\nTo further explore the correlations between the structural characteristics and ORR metrics of the FeNC electrocatalysts, the catalysts synthesized using different NaH2PO2 amounts and P(1)* were employed for the analyses. As shown in Figure 3f and Table S7, the SD value increases with the increase of Fe content (red line). The Fe content (determined by the ICP measurement) of the catalyst and the corresponding SD value can be used to calculate the utilization of Fe–N4 sites in an electrocatalytic process. As presented in Figure 3f, P(1) possesses a high SD of 26 μmol g–1 (5.91 × 1019 site g–1), while it expresses a small Fe utilization of 12.7%; this value is still nearly double the recently reported one. (44) We noticed that the utilization of active sites of the P(0.5), P(1), and P(2) samples are obviously higher than that of the P-undoped (P(0)) and P(1)* ones, highlighting the benefits of more exposed Fe–N4 moieties, owing to additional mesopores and large external surface area derived from the confinement PH3 fumigation. (45,46)\nBased on above results, we plotted the correlations of the micro/meso pore surface area variation, SD, and ORR performance of all samples, although their detailed multirelationship is rather convoluted. (44,47,48) As illustrated by Figure 3g, following the order of P(0), P(1)*, P(2), P(0.5), and P(1), only ∼17.5% of the increase takes place for the surface area of micropore, much smaller than that of mesopore (as high as 93%); meanwhile, the corresponding SD is enhanced distinctly from 16.9 (P(0)) to 26.5 (P(1)) by ∼60%; therefore, statistically one may infer that the creation of a narrow mesopore could contribute more significantly to augment the SD, as it could expose the deeply buried sites. The greater SD of the electrocatalysts results in higher kinetic current densities (Jk at 0.9 V) under the RDE test (Figure 3h). It is noteworthy that although P(1)* bears similar porosity and SD as P(0), except for the presence of P–O bonds, it expresses a better electrocatalytic property, implying that the ORR activity of the Fe–N4 active site can be improved by the P–",

It is noteworthy that although P(1)* bears similar porosity and SD as P(0), except for the presence of P–O bonds, it expresses a better electrocatalytic property, implying that the ORR activity of the Fe–N4 active site can be improved by the P–O bond.\nElectrocatalytic durability is a critical parameter for the commercial viability of the ORR catalysts. The excellent stability of the P–O/FeNC-SAC (P(1)) was further verified by chronoamperometry (CA) tests at a high potential of 0.85 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). As displayed in Figure 3i, the Pt/C catalyst exhibits a 40% decrease in activity, while the P–O/FeNC-SAC shows only a 15% loss of current after 50,000 s. More detailed information about stability can be found in Figure S14. Meanwhile, we further evaluated the performance of the P–O/FeNC-SAC as the oxygen cathode electrocatalyst in a home-built battery (Figure S15a inset). The zinc-air battery (ZAB) assembled with P–O/FeNC-SAC demonstrated a power density of 222.3 mW cm–2, higher than that using Pt/C+IrO2 (166.5 mW cm–2). The P–O/FeNC-SAC-based ZAB also delivered a smaller charge–discharge voltage gap and better durability (300 h) than the Pt/C+IrO2-based one after a long cycle (more details can be found in Figure S15 and Table S8).\nA precise identification of the local structures of nonmetallic species beyond the first coordination shell (n ≥ 2) of metal centers in a heteroatom doping SAC system is still challenging by current characterizing techniques. (49) Therefore, DFT calculations were performed to gain deep insight into how the P–O bond promotes the ORR performance of P–O/FeNC-SAC via long-range or near-range interactions (Figure 4). Based on the experimental characterization results, the structure model was built with an Fe–N4 moiety coordinated by four N atoms (abbreviated as FeNC) with a single P–O bond in the second (2–P-O/FeNC), third (3–P-O/FeNC), fourth (4–P-O/FeNC), and fifth (5–P-O/FeNC) coordination shell of the Fe center (Figure 4a). Their most stable configuration and corresponding relative formation energy were explored (Figure 4a and Figure S16). The five optimized adsorption models involving four intermediate states for the ORR are displayed in Figure 4b and Figure S17. When the electrode potential of all models is set to 0 V (Figure S18), all fundamental reaction stages are exothermic based on the principle of thermodynamics, indicating that the ORR reaction can occur spontaneously for all models along the described reaction pathways.\nFigure 4\nFigure 4. DFT study of the effect of the P–O bond on the ORR activity for FeNC. (a) Schematic illustration of local structures of FeNC with single P–O bond in different shells of one Fe center with the near-/long-range arrangements at their most stable configurations (the orange, blue, gray, red, cyan, and green balls represent the Fe, N, C, O, P, and H atoms, respectively).

  "6": " differential charge densities after *OOH adsorption (yellow and cyan areas represent the positive and negative charges, respectively). (f) Calculated PDOS plots of the Fe center with the aligned Fermi level of the FeNC and 3–P-O/FeNC models.\nTo identify the rate-determining step (RDS), thermodynamic free energy diagrams were computed for the ORR in the five models as a function of electrode potential (Figure 4c, Tables S9–S12). Interestingly, RDS is the first processing step (O2 → *OOH) for all models, as indicated by the smallest limiting potential (U = 1.23 V), denoted as UL(ORR) (0.78, 0.91, 1.03, 0.67, and 0.71 eV, respectively) (Table S13). (50) Incorporating P in the third coordination shell of Fe (3–P-O/FeNC) requires overcoming the RDS energy barrier of 0.204 eV, which is less than that for the FeNC, 2–P-O/FeNC, 4–P-O/FeNC, and 5–P-O/FeNC (0.453, 0.322, 0.561, and 0.521 eV, respectively). The highest activity of *OOH formation can be obtained for the model with the P–O bond presenting in the third coordination shell of the Fe center; when the P–O bond is located in the higher coordinated shells (n ≥ 4) of the Fe–N4 center, the value of ΔG4 for H2O formation is decreased along with exothermic phenomenon in the last step (*OH → H2O), while FeNC catalyst expresses the largest energy barrier (ΔG4 = 0.448 eV). The adsorption-free energies of *OH, *O, and *OOH, (ΔG*OH, ΔG*O, and ΔG*OOH) on various P–O/FeNC structural models summarized in Table S14 manifest a distinct linear relationship between ΔG*OH and ΔG*OOH (Figure 4d, blue line). (51,52) In view of the characteristic RDS of ΔG*OOH, we also graphed the ORR overpotential (ηORR) as a linear function of ΔG*OOH (Figure 4d, red line), suggesting that ΔG*OOH is a valid descriptor of the catalytic activity of the P–O/Fe-NC catalyst, with the smallest ηORR value occurring in the 3-O/FeNC model. Thus, these DFT results validate that the promotion of *OOH formation as an RDS renders 3–P-O/FeNC highly active for ORR.\nAs shown in Figure 4e, the charge density difference maps clearly indicate the charge transfer from the single Fe center to the neighboring N atoms for both models. It ought to be pointed out that the P–O bond doping in the P–O/FeNC model induces an asymmetry in the charge distribution, allowing a larger charge transfer in the FeNC model (top of Figure 4e). For P–O/FeNC, the depletion of electron density mainly appears at the Fe–N4 site and is more concentrated on the Fe center (bottom of Figure 4e). What is more, the FeNC catalyst has a strong oxygen adsorption capacity, which is not conducive to its four-electron selectivity. (53) The calculated partial density of state (PDOS) plot shows a slightly negative shift in the d-band center (−5.278 eV) of Fe for the P–O/FeNC model, compared to the FeNC one (−5.106 eV) (Figure 4f), which can complement the antibonding orbital filling and weaken the dynamic interaction between the active sites and the adsorbates, hence facilitating the ORR kinetics. (54) The above results reveal that the asymmetric Fe site and local engineering via P–O bond doping are capable of synergistically achieving optimized configuration alignment with *OOH and attenuating the formation energy of RDS in ORR. Consequently, the electron-rich Fe center derived from the P–O bond endows P–O/FeNC more favorable for ORR activation.\nIn summary, we have successfully introduced P–O bonds into a N-doped carbon-supported single Fe atom catalyst (P–O/FeNC-SAC), which demonstrated an enhanced ORR performance. The hierarchical porous structure and rational porosity of the best-performing P–O/FeNC-SAC catalyst facilitate mass transfer and accessibility of active sites, especially as an ORR catalyst for ZAB",

The hierarchical porous structure and rational porosity of the best-performing P–O/FeNC-SAC catalyst facilitate mass transfer and accessibility of active sites, especially as an ORR catalyst for ZABs, featuring augmented activity with high peak power density and cycle stability. Experiments combined with DFT calculations demonstrated that P–O in the third coordination shell of the Fe center increased the electron density of Fe, which lowered the reaction energy barrier for *OOH formation and thus synergistically boosted the ORR performance. This work provides a rational avenue for the design of single-atom catalysts with an optimized electronic structure to achieve high catalytic activity for sustainable energy conversion and production.\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.3c01998.\nDetailed experimental procedures; supplementary figures (Figures S1–S18) and tables (Tables S1–S14) on material characterization, battery performance and DFT calculations (PDF)\nnz3c01998_si_001.pdf (2.61 MB)\nTerms & Conditions\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.
