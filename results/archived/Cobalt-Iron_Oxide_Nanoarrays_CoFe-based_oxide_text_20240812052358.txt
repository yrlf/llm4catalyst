Introduction\nWith the rapid increase of distributed power-generation technologies such as wind and solar power plants, the storage of massive excess electricity derived from these intermittent energies is becoming a prominent problem. Electrochemical water splitting for the renewable hydrogen production from these intermittent energies is considered as one of the most promising methods to solve this problem. (1−6) However, the efficiency of energy transformation of electrochemical water splitting for hydrogen production is seriously determined by the sluggish kinetics and the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (η). IrO2 and RuO2 with excellent electrocatalytic properties and superior stability are usually employed as electrocatalysts for OER anode, but their scarcity and high cost impede the large-scale industrial application of hydrogen production. (7−11) To overcome these obstacles, it is very crucial to design novel OER catalysts with superior electrocatalytic activity, low cost, environment friendliness, and superior stability for the industrial applications of electrochemical water splitting under large current densities (>500 mA cm–2).\nTo date, various transition-metal oxides and hydroxides, especially Ni-, Co-, Fe-, and Mn-containing OER catalysts, have been seen as the possible substitutes of precious metal-based OER electrodes, owing to their rich source, low cost, no pollution, and excellent electrochemical stability. (12−18) Among these metal oxides, spinel Co3O4 is regarded as one of the most attractive OER catalysts with intriguing advantages of cost-effectiveness, high thermal stability, rich sources, and environment friendliness. (19−23) However, compared to precious RuO2- and IrO2-based catalysts, Co3O4-based electrode still has poor electrocatalytic activity and high overpotential due to the low amount of active sites and poor conductivity and thus its application for electrochemical water splitting at large current densities is still not practical. (19−23) To improve the electrocatalytic activity at large current densities, the reactivity and the number of active sites need to be further enhanced. So far, two effective strategies have been developed for this purpose. On the one hand, the incorporation of other elements (e.g., Fe, Ni, Mn, etc.) into pristine metal oxides or hydroxides has been proven to efficiently increase the electrocatalytic activity and reduce the overpotential of OER, due to a variation of oxygen vacancies or a decrease of surface adsorption energy of the intermediate products. (1,18,24−32) For instance, Trotochaud group has confirmed that the Fe addition in Ni oxide can bring a >30-fold increase of conductivity and a great decrease of OER overpotential. (24) In our recent study, it was proved that the doping of other elements in clean metal oxides can increase both the conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of OER catalysts, deriving from the increase of defects or oxygen vacancies in the structures. (18) On the other hand, the structural engineering and nanocrystallization of the electrocatalyst materials could undoubtedly enhance the OER performance. For example, Co3O4 nanosheets (NSs), Fe-based nanotubes, Ni-based oxide nanosheets, and so on have been fabricated and demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activities as OER electrodes. (3,12,20,25,33)\nThe poor stability of nonprecious metal-based oxide electrocatalysts during OER process, especially at large current densities, is one of the most challenging issues that hinder the massive applications. The IrO2- and RuO2-based electrode materials usually have high stability in acidic or neutral solutions. For example, IrO2/Ta2O5 and IrO2/MnO2 composites coated on Ti substrate can exhibit superior stability (>800 h) for OER at 2000 mA cm–2 in acid solution. (11,34−36) However, the stability evaluation of the present nonprecious metal-based electrodes was usually carried out at <200 mA cm–2 with a short period in alkaline media, which is insufficient for the practical stability assessment. Although the electrocatalytic activity of nonprecious metal oxides has been proved to be comparable to that of noble-metal oxides, more efforts should be made to further improve the stability of nonprecious metal-based electrocatalysts.\nHere, we demonstrate that both the electrocatalytic activity and OER stability of Co-based oxide electrocatalyst can be greatly enhanced by the incorporation of Fe atoms.

Through a facile hydrothermal synthesis and thermal treatment approach, highly homogeneous CoxFe3–xO4 nanoarrays were grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) support with three-dimensional macroporous structure, excellent electrical properties, and good electrochemical stability. Benefitted from the excellent electrochemical stability of the CoxFe3–xO4 nanoarrays, the high passivation resistance of CFP support, and the good interface connect between CoxFe3–xO4 nanoarrays and CFP support, the composite electrodes exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity at large current densities for electrocatalytic OER.\n2. Results and Discussion\nScheme 1 exhibits the fabrication procedure of the CoxFe3–xO4-NWs/CFP and CoxFe3–xO4-NSs/CFP composite electrodes. The CFP that consists of carbon fibers with a diameter (5–10 μm) was employed as the support substrate (see Figure S1). The arrays of CoxFe3–xO4 nanowires (NWs) and nanosheets were homogeneously grown and formed on the surface of carbon fibers using facile hydrothermal synthesis and thermal decomposition methods. (4,6,37,38) The morphologies and the thicknesses of CoxFe3–xO4 nanoarrays can be well controlled by varying the concentration of hydrosolvent. With increasing the Fe3+ concentration in the hydrosolvent, the morphology of CoxFe3–xO4 nanoarrays gradually changed from nanowires to nanosheets. All of the CoxFe3–xO4 nanowires/nanosheets have strong interface connection with the CFP substrate, resulting in the high robustness of CoxFe3–xO4 nanowires/nanosheets during the OER process at large current densities. Moreover, these kinds of one- and two-dimensional nanoarray architectures favorably facilitate the electrolyte infiltration onto the active sites, thus increasing the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) for the OER.\nScheme 1\nScheme 1. Schematic Fabrication Process of the CoxFe3–xO4-NWs/CFP and CoxFe3–xO4-NSs/CFP Composite Electrodes\nFigure 1 displays the highly homogeneous CoxFe3–xO4 nanowire (CoxFe3–xO4-NWs/CFP) and CoxFe3–xO4 nanosheet (CoxFe3–xO4-NSs/CFP) arrays grown on CFP, which are achieved through the precise control of the metal-ion concentration in the hydrosolvent. The Fe/Co molar ratios of CoxFe3–xO4-NWs/CFP and CoxFe3–xO4-NSs/CFP composites are approximately 1/8 and 3/10, respectively, corresponding to Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composites (see Table S1 and Figure S2). It is revealed that the Fe3+ concentration in the hydrosolvent has a large influence on the morphology of CoxFe3–xO4 nanoarrays. When the Fe3+ concentration was set to zero, pure Co3O4 nanowires were homogeneously formed on the surface of carbon fibers (see Figure S3), which is consistent with the literature. (39) When the Fe3+ concentration was increased to 0.1 M, the resultant Co2.7Fe0.3O4 still maintained the morphology of the nanowire, as shown in Figure 1a–c. The Co2.7Fe0.3O4 nanowires with a diameter of approximately 100 nm (see Figure 2a) were homogeneously grown on the surface of carbon fibers. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images (see Figure 2b,c) of the multicrystalline Co2.7Fe0.3O4 nanowires show the presence of lattice fringes and diffraction rings indexed as the (111), (220), (311), (511), and (440) crystal faces of spinel Co3O4, which is",

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images (see Figure 2b,c) of the multicrystalline Co2.7Fe0.3O4 nanowires show the presence of lattice fringes and diffraction rings indexed as the (111), (220), (311), (511), and (440) crystal faces of spinel Co3O4, which is coincident with the analysis in Figure 3a. When the Fe3+ concentration was increased to 0.3 M in the hydrosolvent, the morphology of CoxFe3–xO4 changed from nanowires to nanosheets. The Co2.3Fe0.7O4 nanosheets with ultrathin thickness (see Figures 1d–f and 2d) were homogeneously formed on the surface of carbon fibers. HRTEM and SAED images (see Figure 2e,f) of the multicrystalline Co2.3Fe0.7O4 nanosheets exhibit the lattice fringes and diffraction rings indexed as the (220), (511), and (440) crystal faces of spinel Co3O4, which is coincident with the analysis in Figure 3a. The morphologies of the as-prepared CoxFe3–xO4 nanowire and nanosheet arrays grown on CFP in this work are more homogeneous than those of CoFe compound nanoarrays grown on other substrates (such as Ni foam and Cu foam) in the literature, (38,40) which is beneficial to the electrochemical stability of composite electrodes.\nFigure 1\nFigure 1.

For comparison, the CFP and the Co3O4-NWs/CFP composite (see Figure S3) are also measured. The diffraction peaks of the CFP substrate appearing at 26.4, 29.4, 36.0, 39.5, 43.2, 47.5, and 54.5° originated from the CFP substrate, corresponding to two kinds of diffraction peaks of carbon including Graphite-2H (JCPDS No. 41-1487) and Chaoite [NR] (JCPDS No. 22-1069). Except for these diffraction peaks of the substrate, the diffraction peaks of the Co3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP, and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composites located at 19.1, 31.3, 36.8, 44.7, 59.3, and 65.2° correspond to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) crystal faces of spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS No. 42-1467).

Clearly, no other diffraction peaks are discovered in the XRD patterns of the Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composites except for that of the CFP and Co3O4. Combined with the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Table S1 and Figure S2), it is clear that Fe species have been doped into the crystalline structure of spinel CoxFe3–xO4, indicating the formation of composite nanowires and nanosheets of binary metal oxides. These consequences prove that the incorporation of Fe atoms has almost no change in the crystal structure of spinel Co3O4. (38) The texture coefficients of crystal facets (TC (hkl)) can reflect the preferred crystalline orientation of CoxFe3–xO4 nanowire and nanosheet. The TC (hkl) values of different facets in the Co3O4-NWs, Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs, and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs are shown in Figure S4. The TC (hkl) values of the (111) and (400) facets of Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs have an obvious variation compared to those of Co3O4-NWs and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs, indicating the change of the preferred crystalline orientation to a certain extent. The preferred crystalline orientation of Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs is the (400) plane, rather than the (111) plane for Co3O4-NWs and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs. Moreover, the morphology change may be the consequence of the variation of the preferred growth orientation with increasing Fe3+ concentration, which is similar to the change of the preferred crystalline orientation (see Figure S4).\nFigure 3b–d displays the XPS images of the Co3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP, and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP. Clearly, the overall XPS images of Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP definitely exhibit the existence of Co, Fe, and O elements, further confirming the introduction of Fe ion. The Co 2p spectra of the samples in Figure 3b present doublets at 780.3 and 795.57 eV that correspond to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2. The Co 2p3/2 spectra can be divided into two fitting peaks of Co2+ (782.2 eV) and Co3+ (780.1 eV), which is consistent with the valence states of Co species in spinel Co3O4. The Fe 2p spectra of the Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP in Figure 3c exhibit pairs of peaks located at 725.2 and 711.5 eV, with a spin-energy separation of 13.7 eV, corresponding to the Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 signals. The O 1s spectra of the Co3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP, and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP in Figure 3d can be decomposed into four characteristic peaks that resulted from metal-oxygen bounds (529.9 eV for O1), defective oxygen sites with a low coordination number (531.1 eV for O2), hydroxyl groups or surface-absorbed oxygen (532.3 eV for O3), and adsorbed molecular water (533.4 eV for O4).

(25,41) Interestingly, the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP has a higher O3 ratio (17.5%) compared to Co3O4-NWs/CFP (8.0%) and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP (6.4%). This consequence indicates that the different morphologies and Fe contents in CoxFe3–xO4 nanoarrays can result in different surface characteristics that are very important to the adsorption of intermediate products (OH*, O2*, O*, and OOH*) for the OER, especially the hydroxyl groups (O3). (42−44) All of the highly recognized mechanisms for the OER in alkaline conditions involve in the elementary step that is the adsorption–desorption of OH̅ ion on the surface of active site (S). (45) The elementary step is given below\n(1)\nUndoubtedly, the surface of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP with a high O3 ratio (17.5%) possesses more active sites to adsorb hydroxide ion and finish the OER, indicating higher ECSA and electrocatalytic activity in comparison with Co3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP.\nFigure 4a exhibits the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the Co3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP, and IrO2/CFP composite electrodes at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 in a 1 M KOH medium. As shown in the figure, the current density of the bare CFP for the OER is considerably lower than that of the CoxFe3–xO4-loaded composite electrodes. The onset overpotentials of the Co3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP, and IrO2/CFP composite electrodes were 181, 166, 169, and 91 mV, respectively. The overpotentials of the OER at 10 mA cm–2 for the Co3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP, and IrO2/CFP composite electrodes were 372, 342, 359, and 245 mV, respectively. Clearly, the onset overpotentials and overpotentials at 10 mA cm–2 of the Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoarray electrodes are lower than those of the clean Co3O4 nanoarray electrode. The Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode at an OER overpotential of 500 mV can reach a higher current density (106.8 mA cm–2) than that of Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP (64.4 mA cm–2) and Co3O4-NWs/CFP (42.0 mA cm–2). It is obvious that the current densities of Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrodes at the same OER overpotential are higher than those for Co3O4-NWs/CFP composite electrode, indicating that the Fe doping in the pristine Co3O4 nanostructures can greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity. Figure 4b exhibits the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the samples performed in the potential region (1.167–1.267 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a scan rate of 10 mV s–1 in a 1 M KOH solution.

Clearly, the regulation for the current density values of anode (ja) and cathode (jc) of these samples is homologous to that of the OER current densities under the same overpotential in Figure 4a. The electrocatalytic activity of nanocomposite electrodes was further evaluated by the ECSA. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is proportional to ECSA, which is generally used to evaluate the effective ECSA. The Cdl evaluation for the ECSA of these samples is only qualitative owing to the pseudocapacitance characteristic for these metal-based oxides. (18,46−48) The CV curves were recorded in the nonfaradic range (1.167–1.267 V vs RHE) within the scan rate region (2–20 mV s–1). Figure 4c exhibits the capacitance currents of these nanocomposite electrodes with scan rate. The Cdl of the nanocomposite electrodes was obtained by fitting a linear regression according to the capacitance currents of the CV curves in Figure S5. The Cdl of the Co3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP, and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrodes are 17.8, 33.0, and 64.1 mF cm–2, respectively, indicating that the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode has the highest effective ECSA among these samples. Figure S6 shows the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the Co3O4-NWs/CFP, Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP, and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composites. The curve of these samples shows an obvious hysteresis loop from P/P0 = 0.4 to 0.99, which belong to a typical IV-type isotherm. (49−51) This indicates that mesopores (2–50 nm) are dominant in these nanocomposites. Table S2 exhibits that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area of Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP (18.2 m2 g–1) is higher than that of Co3O4-NWs/CFP (7.6 m2 g–1) and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP (4.5 m2 g–1), which should be the consequence of the lower average pore size. These BET data are consistent with the Cdl values of the nanocomposite electrodes in Figure 4c. These data clearly indicate that the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NS arrays have much superior electrocatalytic activity compared to the Co3O4-NW and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NW nanoarrays. This consequence should be attributed to the morphology of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP that can provide more surface active sites and higher Fe-doping content.\nFigure 4\nFigure 4.

(41,52) However, for electrochemical water splitting, the current densities are normally much higher (>500 mA cm–2) to fulfill industrial demands. (2) Hence, to reasonably assess the electrode performance for electrocatalytic OER, the onset potential and the overpotential are not enough. Tafel slopes are usually employed to identify the reaction kinetics of electrodes and can therefore serve as a crucial parameter for electrocatalytic OER, especially at large current densities. Typically, the smaller the Tafel slopes, the higher the OER current densities at the same overpotential. Figure 4d shows the iRs-corrected Tafel plots of the samples derived from the LSVs in Figure 4a. For accurate comparison of Tafel plots, the Rs of all of the electrodes was taken as the same value of 1.1 Ω, and the Tafel slopes were calculated in an appropriate range of current densities. As shown in Figure 4d, the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode has a lower Tafel slope (34.3 mV dec–1) than Co3O4-NWs/CFP (188.7 mV dec–1), Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP (139.2 mV dec–1), and IrO2/CFP (41.2 mV dec–1). This should be attributed to the higher ECSA and a high O3 ratio of Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP for the adsorption of intermediate products. Table S3 exhibits the electrocatalytic activities for some advanced electrodes for OER. The OER overpotential of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP electrode at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 is comparable to these electrodes, as shown in the table. It is also obvious that the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP electrode possesses a much lower Tafel slope of 34.3 mV dec–1 than these advanced materials, indicating the superior electrocatalytic activity at large current density of electrochemical water splitting.\nFigure 4e shows the Nyquist plots of these composite electrodes. The equivalent circuit, Rs(Cdl(RctZw)), is used to fit the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data of these nanocomposite electrodes for OER, which has been inserted in the figure. (53,54)Rs corresponds to the bulk solution resistance, Cdl represents the double-layer capacitance, Rct corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance, and Zw is the Warburg resistance. The fitted EIS data for these electrodes are exhibited in Table S4. As shown in the table, Rct of Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP (10.3 Ω cm–2) for the OER is lower than that of Co3O4-NWs/CFP (50.3 Ω cm–2) and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP (40.9 Ω cm–2), indicating that more excellent electrocatalytic activity resulted from the higher Fe-doping content. (18)\nFigure 4f shows continuous multistep chronopotentiometric curves in a 1 M KOH solution. These nanocomposite electrodes are subjected to a long-term OER of 60 000 s at different current densities (20–500 mA cm–2). As shown in the figure, the OER potential of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode is much lower than that of Co3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP at the same current density.

As shown in the figure, the OER potential of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode is much lower than that of Co3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP at the same current density. It is also obvious that the OER potential of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode has a very small fluctuation during the 60 000 s electrolysis at different current densities, indicating the excellent OER stability. In contrast, the Co3O4-NWs/CFP electrode has very large fluctuation of the potential at current densities ≥200 mA cm–2 with time. The current–time chronoamperometric responses further confirm the excellent OER stability of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP electrode with higher OER current density compared to the Co3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP electrodes (see Figure S7). These chronopotentiometric responses reflect higher OER stability and better mass transport characteristics (external diffusion of O2 bubbles and inner diffusion of OH–), mechanical robustness, and conductivity of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP nanocomposite electrode compared to Co3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP.\nThe OER stability of the electrodes at large current densities for electrochemical water splitting is very important due to the requirements for industrial applications. It is obvious that the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode for the OER possesses outstanding long-term stability at large current densities (see Table S3). Figure 5 shows the morphologies of the Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrodes after electrochemical OER for 100 h at a current density of 1000 mA cm–2. The nanosheet array morphology of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode in Figure 5a–c showed almost no change compared to the fresh electrode in Figure 2d–f, indicating its high stability at a high current density. However, the morphology of the Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP was changed to a certain extent (Figure 5d–f). It was also discovered that the Fe contents in Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP relatively decreased after the OER for 100 h (see Table S1, Figure S2, Table S5, and Figure S8). Figure S9 exhibits the XRD patterns of the samples after the OER for 100 h at 1000 mA cm–2. The CoxFe3–xO4 nanowire/nanosheet after the OER for 100 h still well maintained the crystalline structure of spinel Co3O4. However, the diffraction peak of the Co3O4 (440) crystal face for the Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP composite electrode appearing at 65.2° greatly decreased compared to the fresh electrode, but that for the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode had nearly no variation. This result indicates that the Co2.3Fe0.7O4 nanosheet has higher structure and composition stability than the Co2.7Fe0.3O4 nanowire during the long-term OER at large current densities. Figure S10 shows the XPS images of Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP corresponding to the fresh electrodes and the electrodes after electrochemical OER for 100 h at 1000 mA cm–2. It is discovered that the Fe 2p spectra of fresh Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP and after 100 h of the OER in Figure S10c had almost no change, indicating a small variation of the Fe-doping content on the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NS surface.

However, the Fe spectra of the Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP after 100 h of electrocatalytic OER nearly vanished compared to those of the fresh electrode, indicating the removal of Fe atoms on the Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NW surface. This reason should be the consequence of the variation of the preferred crystalline orientation (Figure S4), indicating that Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs can more effectively preserve the Fe species on the exposed facets compared to Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NW. It is also discovered that Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP and Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP have a large change in the content ratios of O1, O2, O3, and O4, indicating the variation of surface characteristics for the adsorption of intermediate products after long-term OER (Figure S10e). (40−42)\nFigure 5\nFigure 5. FESEM images showing the morphologies of (a–c) Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP and (d–f) Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP composites after electrochemical OER for 100 h at 1000 mA cm–2.\nGenerally, the electrochemical stability of active materials and the surface passivation of support materials are the main factors of the OER stability for metal-based oxide electrodes. (54,55) However, the OER stability of nanostructural materials is different from that of the traditional precious metal oxide electrocatalysts. In this study, the high stability of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrodes at large OER current densities should be attributed to several key factors: (1) the CFP substrate possesses high corrosion resistance and excellent electrical properties, which make it suitable to serve as the support substrate of nanoarrays for the OER. Unlike the metal substrate, the CFP hardly passivates under high overpotential during long-term OER. (2) The highly homogeneous Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NS arrays grown on CFP have high robustness and strong interface connection with the CFP substrate, which make them ultrastable even under strong OER (>500 mA cm–2). (3) Compared to Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs, Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs have higher structure and composition stability during the long-term OER at large current densities, owing to the change of the preferred crystalline orientation. Consequently, the CoxFe3–xO4-NSs/CFP composite electrodes have excellent electrocatalytic activity and superior stability compared to RuO2- and IrO2-based electrocatalysts. (34−36,56,57)\n3. Conclusions\nTo summarize, ultrathin CoxFe3–xO4 nanosheet/nanowire arrays grown on CFP for the electrocatalytic OER were successfully fabricated. The incorporation of Fe atoms into the spinel Co3O4 and the ultrathin nanosheet morphology can greatly improve the electrocatalytic activity and OER stability at large current densities. The Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP composite electrode for the OER exhibited a small value of Tafel slope (34.3 mV dec–1) and superior stability at the current density of 1000 mA cm–2 for 100 h without a morphology change. The fabrication of the Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP electrode for the electrochemical OER provides new insights to design nonprecious, highly active, and stable metal oxide composite electrodes for the possibility of large-scale practical applications.\n4.

(Shanghai, China) and used as raw materials for the electrode preparation without further purification.\n4.2. Electrode Preparation\nA CFP (TGH-060, Toray Industries Co., Ltd.) was cut into pieces of 10 mm × 60 mm × 0.33 mm and employed as the support substrate for the fabrication of the nanoarray composite electrodes. The pieces of CFP were subjected to surface pretreatments by ethanol, 0.1 M H2SO4 medium, and deionized water in sequence for 10 min in an ultrasonic water bath. Meanwhile, the mixed hydrosolvents of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, CO(NH2)2, and NH4F with different concentrations were prepared in 80 mL of deionized water (see Table S6). The concentration parameters for the fabrication of Co3O4 nanowire (Co3O4-NWs/CFP), CoxFe3–xO4 nanowire (Co2.7Fe0.3O4-NWs/CFP), and CoxFe3–xO4 (Co2.3Fe0.7O4-NSs/CFP) nanosheet arrays grown on CFP correspond to the Fe/Co molar ratios of 0, 1/3.74, and 3/3.74 in the hydrosolvents (see Table S6). The hydrosolvent was poured into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, and the CFP was completely immersed in the solution. The autoclave was sealed and heated in a furnace at 120 °C for 3–7 h and then naturally cooled to room temperature. After the hydrothermal process, the CFP was taken out and washed with water several times. After drying at 60 °C, the CoxFe1–x(OH)(CO3)0.5 nanoarrays were successfully synthesized on CFP. (6,34−36) The dried CoxFe1–x(OH)(CO3)0.5 nanoarray composite electrodes were then heated in air at 350 °C for 2 h to fully convert into crystalline CoxFe3–xO4 nanoarrays. All of the nanocomposite electrodes ensure an approximate loading of active material (4–5 mg cm–2). For comparison, the IrO2/CFP composite electrode was also fabricated using the method of thermal decomposition according to the previous method. (18)\n4.3. Material Characterizations\nThe crystallinity of these nanocomposite electrodes was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance-A25). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Supra-55), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEIG2-20-TWIN), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford Instruments) were employed to analyze the morphologies and compositions of the nanocomposite electrodes. The valence states of the CoxFe3–xO4 nanoarrays were measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Axis Ultra DLD electron spectrometer (Shimadzu-Kratos) at 150 W Al Kα radiation. An analytical balance (Mettler Toledo, XS205 Dual Range) was employed to weigh the loading amounts of active materials on CFP.\n4.4. Electrochemical Characterizations\nAn electrochemical workstation (CHI 660D, CH Instruments Inc.) with a three-electrode configuration was used to perform the electrochemical behavior of these samples in a 1 M KOH medium at 25 °C. A saturated calomel electrode was calibrated to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which was employed as the reference electrode. (18) The nanocomposite electrodes with a geometric area (10 mm × 10 mm) were used as the working electrodes, and the auxiliary electrode was a Pt foil. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves of the samples were performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the frequency region of 100 kHz to 10 mHz at a potential (1.070 V vs RHE) of the Cdl region using a 5 mV signal. The corresponding Tafel plots for the collected iRs drop were obtained. The iRs drop is derived from the EIS, where i corresponds to the faradic current of LSV and Rs represents the electroly",

The corresponding Tafel plots for the collected iRs drop were obtained. The iRs drop is derived from the EIS, where i corresponds to the faradic current of LSV and Rs represents the electrolyte resistance that is determined by the X axis intercepts of the Nyquist plots. The chronopotentiometric curves for these nanocomposite electrodes were obtained under the same experimental setup of a three-electrode configuration with compensating iRs drop in a 1 M KOH medium. The long-term OER stabilities for the nanocomposite electrodes were measured with 1000 mA cm–2 in the 1 M KOH medium at room temperature. The different nanoarray electrodes were applied as the anode, and pure titanium plate with a size of 40 mm × 40 mm was used as the cathode, which assembled a cell for electrochemical water splitting.\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsami.8b15357.\nFESEM images, EDS mappings, TC (hkl) values, CV curves, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, XRD patterns, XPS images (Figures S1–S10); normalized atomic ratios, summary of specific surface area, pore size and pore volume, comparison of electrocatalytic activities, normalized atomic ratios of Co and Fe, and influence of reagent concentrations (Tables S1–S6) (PDF)\nam8b15357_si_001.pdf (1.86 MB)\nTerms & Conditions\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.
