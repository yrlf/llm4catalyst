However, the poor electrocatalytic activity still remains a huge challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a feasible approach through oxidation of CoFe layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) to synthesize Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles with size of about 30‒50 nm. As OER catalyst, the as-synthesized Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles exhibited superior OER performance with a small overpotential of 260 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm−2, a small Tafel slope of 70 mV dec−1 and long-term durability (there was no obviously OER current density degradation for 100 h) in alkaline solution. The present work opens a new avenue to the exploration of cost-effective and excellent electrocatalysts based on transition metal oxide materials to substitute precious metal materials for water splitting.\nNanosized Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles with porous structure have been fabricated by oxidation of CoFe layered double hydroxide and exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity and superior durability.\nDownload: Download high-res image (149KB)\nDownload: Download full-size image\nThe rapid energy demand from fossil fuels coupled with the related environment problems has prompted scientists to develop clean and sustainable energy with earth abundance, high efficiency, low cost and environment-friendly. Electricity-driven water splitting should be one of the most promising and appealing strategies to generate clean and renewable fuels, such as molecular hydrogen and oxygen\n[1]\n,\n[2]\n,\n[3]\n,\n[4]\n,\n[5]\n. However, as half-reaction of the water splitting reaction, the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck of water splitting because of its sluggish kinetics\n[6]\n,\n[7]\n,\n[8]\n. Therefore, highly efficient OER catalysts must be explored to expedite the reaction kinetics and reduce the overpotential. Currently, precious metal-based materials, such as iridium oxide and ruthenium oxide, are employed as the benchmarked OER electrocatalysts\n[9]\n,\n[10]\n,\n[11]\n. Nevertheless, high costs and poor resources hinder them from the large-scale application. Therefore, it is imperative to develop earth-abundant and low-cost substituted OER electrocatalysts with high activity for water splitting. Recently, the first-row transition-metal (Ni, Co, Fe and Mn) hydroxides and oxides have been explored as the most promising catalysts for OER on account of their low cost, earth-abundance and long-term electrocatalytic stability\n[12]\n,\n[13]\n,\n[14]\n,\n[15]\n,\n[16]\n. Among them, Co3O4 has been intensively researched as one of the most attractive OER electrocatalysts because of its cost effectiveness, natural abundance, excellent electrocatalytic activity and high anticorrosion stability\n[17]\n,\n[18]\n,\n[19]\n. However, the kinetics during the redox reactions is normally limited by poor electrical conductivity and the slow ion diffusion near the electrode surface. Hence, further efforts are required to achieve the higher conductivity and faster ion transport of Co3O4 to improve the electrocatalytic activity.\nNumerous research works have certified that the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts with nanostructure can be greatly enhanced by doping of transition metals (Ni, Fe, Zn, W, etc.) owing to that the crystalline structure of the host could be fine-adjusted by introduction of foreign metals\n[20]\n,\n[21]\n,\n[22]\n. For example, Boettcher and co-workers found that the conductivity of NiOOH increases > 30-fold when Fe doping, much more, with the effect of Fe, the NiOOH electronic structure has been changed by inducing partial-charge transfer, leading to a well OER performance\n[23]\n. Bell and co-workers claimed that, compared with pure Ni and Fe composites, the OER performance of Ni1−xFexOOH can greatly enhanced with the Fe dopant.

The unusual short distance of FeO bond formed by edge-sharing with surrounding [NiO6] octahedral, resulting in one of the most active OER catalysts\n[24]\n. In another way, the OER activity of the catalysts can be tuned by the design of morphology and size. Nanomaterials, by contrast of bulk materials, can provide much more active sites, higher specific surface area\n[25]\n,\n[26]\n,\n[27]\n. Based on the above consideration, it should be a promising pathway to enhance the OER performance by fabrication of uniformly dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles with doping foreign metals. However, it is hard to fabricate the doping Co3O4 nanoparticles in a facile way because the nanomaterials tend to aggregate owing to its higher surface energy, which usually results in decreased electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and worse electrochemical performance\n[28]\n,\n[29]\n,\n[30]\n.\nLayered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of layered materials with the positively charged layers consisting of alternately arranged metal cations (usually M2+ and M3+) balanced by charge-compensating anions positioned within the interlayer space\n[31]\n,\n[32]\n. LDHs have been widely studied to act as OER electrocatalysts due to the unique physical and chemical properties, e.g., tunable metal species and ratio, uniform distribution of elements\n[33]\n,\n[34]\n,\n[35]\n. Furthermore, nanoparticles with well dispersion can be obtained through the in situ topotactic transformation of LDHs under reduction and/or oxidation conditions due to the fact that LDHs can act as a support preventing sintering of the nanoparticles\n[36]\n.\nIn this work, the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles were successfully fabricated via a simple and novel method. First, CoFe-LDH nanosheets were synthesized as precursor through a simple co-precipitation method. After a soft oxidation procedure, we got the Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles. With the help of glucose in hydrothermal condition and calcination, the surface of Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles was covered with a layer of carbon with nanoscale thickness. The reason for choosing CoFe-LDH as precursor is that the cobalt and iron atoms have a well dispersion in the layer of CoFe-LDH, which could provide the convenient conditions for the formation of Fe-doped Co3O4. Moreover, the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles can afford abundant active sites and fast mass transport ability. Furthermore, the ultrathin carbon layer coated on the surface of Fe-doped Co3O4 cannot only enhance the conductivity but also prevent the active materials from agglomerating, leading to a well stability during the long-term electrochemical process. In electrochemical measurement, Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles exhibited excellent electrocatalytic property in OER, which revealed a low overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 20 mA/cm2 with a small Tafel slope of 70 mV/decade.\nThe CoFe LDH nanoplatelets were synthesized by a co-precipitation method\n[37]\n. Typically, the pH of the aqueous solution (50 mL) containing Co(NO3)2·6H2O (0.16 M), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.055 M) and NH4F (0.3 g) was adjusted to 8.0 with NaOH solution (2 M), and aged in an Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves at 80 °C for 12 h. The resulted CoFe-LDH (0.3 g) was subsequently dissolved in a solution of 0.1 M KBrO3 which was maintained at 70 °C for 6 h. The obtained solid is Fe-doped Co3O4 after filtration.\n300 mg of Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles was dispersed in 30 mL deionized water by ultrasonicating to form a suspension (namely A). 600 mg of glucose (C6H12O6·3H2O) was dissolved in another 30 mL deionized water (namely B).

Suspension A and another 25 mL of ethanol were added into the solution B under gentle stirring for 20 min. The mixture was transferred into a 100 mL of Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 120 °C for 6 h. The carbon precursor-coated Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles were cleaned with deionized water several times and dried at 60 °C in an oven. The resulting sample was placed in the tube furnace and annealed under a N2 atmosphere at 550 °C for 90 min.\nThe Fe–Co3O4@C nanosheets were synthesized with the same way as the fabrication of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles just in the absence of oxidation process.\nThe Co(OH)2 was synthesized with the same way as the fabrication of CoFe-LDH just in the absence of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O. The resulted precipitate was placed in the tube furnace and annealed under N2 atmosphere at 450 °C for 120 min.\nX-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffraction instrument (Rigaku D/max 2500) at a scan rate of 10° per minute in the 2θ range from 3° to 70°. The FT-IR spectra were recorded from 3700 to 400 cm−1 on a Bruker Vector-22 FT-IR spectrophotometer using the KBr pellet technique. The Raman spectra were obtained with a Jobin Yvon Horiba Raman spectrometer model HR800 using a 532 nm line of Ar-ion laser as the excitation source at room temperature. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) measurements were carried out on an Oxford Instrument INCAx-act EDX detector attached to a Zeiss Supra 55 field emission scanning electron microscopy using a 15 kV electron beam and 60 s acquisition time. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out on a Hitachi H-800 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy was carried out on a Shimadzu ICPS-7500 instrument. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a model of ESCALAB 250. Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) measurements were performed at the 1W1B beamline of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were conducted on a micromeritics ACAP 2020 analyzer. Samples were out-gassed at 373 K for 6 h. The specific surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method upon the adsorption branch and the pore size distribution by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method upon the desorption branch of the isotherms.\nElectrochemical measurements were performed with a three-electrode system in 1 M aqueous KOH solution at room temperature using configuration connected to an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, CH Instruments Inc., Chenghua, Shanghai). The counter electrode was platinum wire and the reference electrode was saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The preparation method of the working electrodes is as follows: 5 mg of catalyst powder was dispersed in 985 µL of anhydrous ethanol and 250 µL water mixed solvent with 40 µL of Nafion solution (5 wt%, DuPont). The mixture was then ultrasonicated for about 40 min to generate a homogeneous ink. Next, the dispersion ink was uniformly transferred onto foam nickel electrodes, leading to a catalyst loading of ∼5 mg cm−2. Finally, the as-prepared working electrodes were dried at 60 °C for 1 h. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were gained in 1 M KOH solution at room temperature at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1.

For the purpose of comparison, the Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles, FeCo3O4@C nanosheets, CoFe-LDH and pure Co3O4 were also used as working electrode and studied under the same condition. All the polarization curves were not iR-corrected. Tafel plot measurements were obtained under a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The impedance measurements were performed in the same configuration at 1.51 V (vs. RHE) over a frequency range from 1000 kHz to 0.01 Hz at room temperature. The stability of catalyst was evaluated by Current–time curve method at 1.50 V (vs. RHE) for Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles and at 1.53 V for Fe-doped Co3O4 in alkaline solution. The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of prepared catalysts was studied via the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) measurements by the series of cyclic voltammograms at the non-Faradaic region (0.056‒0.106 V vs. SCE) at different scan rates of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mV s−1.\nThe fabrication process for Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles is clearly illustrated in\nFig. 1\n(a). As described, CoFe-LDH was synthesized as precursor via a simple and general of co-precipitation method. Afterward, the resulting CoFe-LDH precursor was oxidized with potassium bromate (KBrO3) solution at 70 °C for 6 h. After the oxidation, the CoFe-LDH changed into Fe-doped Co3O4. Subsequently, the surface of Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles was coated with glucose polymer through a hydrothermal method, and finally transformed into Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles after calcined at 550 °C for 90 min in N2 atmosphere. The crystal phases of the precursor and product were investigated by XRD technique. For the CoFe-LDH, a series of diffraction peaks located on 11.2°, 23.1°, 33.8°, 38.4° and 59.1° in the XRD pattern (\nFig. 1\n(b)) can be attributed to the typical (003), (006), (012), (015), and (110) planes of the LDH structure, respectively, indicating a successfully formation of CoFe-LDH\n[38]\n. After oxidation, all diffraction peaks of the obtained composite, as shown in\nFig. 1\n(c) curve (1), well matched with the reference of Co3O4 phase (PDF#43-1003), where all diffraction peaks slightly shift (∼0.3°, 2θ) to the lower angles, indicating the possible substitution of Co by Fe atoms in Co3O4. Furthermore, the XRD pattern of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles was also displayed in\nFig. 1\n(c) curve (2), which is also in good agreement with that of Co3O4. Here, the absence of a weak peak at 2θ ≈ 24°‒25° in the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles is consistent with an amorphous graphitized carbon, which suggests that graphitized carbon is indeed obtained by carbon coating\n[39]\n.\nFig. 1.

For Co3O4 (curve 1), the peaks at 3435 and 1630 cm−1 are originated from the bending and stretching vibration modes of the absorbed water molecules.

For Co3O4 (curve 1), the peaks at 3435 and 1630 cm−1 are originated from the bending and stretching vibration modes of the absorbed water molecules. Two distinct bands at 663 and 571 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibrations of CoO bonds in Co3O4, which confirms the spinel structure of Co3O4\n[40]\n. For Fe-doped Co3O4 (curve 2), these modes are shifted slightly to lower wave number region, which is associated with the changes in the surface defects due to doping. After carbon decoration, compared with Co3O4 and Fe-doped Co3O4, there is no obvious distinction in the FI–IR spectra for the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles (curve 3). The Raman spectra of the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles, Fe-doped Co3O4, and Co3O4 catalysts are shown in\nFig. 2\n(b). For Co3O4 (curve 1), there are four peaks located at 476, 528, 600 and 658 cm−1, respectively, which belong to the Eg, F2g, F2g and A1g modes of Co3O4\n[40]\n. The Raman spectra of the Fe-doped Co3O4 and Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles are similar to that of Co3O4 (curves 2 and 3), but the peaks are shifted slightly to the lower wave number due to the changes in the grain size of doped Co3O4. However, the Raman bands of the graphite carbon were not found in Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles, in line with the good dispersion of graphite carbon on the surface of Fe-doped Co3O4 and amorphization of the carbon\n[39]\n.\nFig. 2. (a) FT-IR spectra and (b) Raman spectra of Co3O4 (1), Fe-doped Co3O4 (2) and Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles (3).\nAs shown in\nFig. 3\n(a) and (d), the CoFe-LDH displays a typical nanoplate structure with a size in the range from 80 to 300 nm, and the thickness of CoFe-LDH nanoplates was about 15 nm. Amazingly, after oxidation by KBrO3, a definite change in the morphology was observed (\nFig. 3\n(b) and (e)), where the CoFe-LDH nanoplates transformed into Fe-doped Co3O4 fragments composed of nanoparticles. Furthermore, after adsorption of glucose and calcination, as shown in\nFig. 3\n(c) and (f), the morphology of as-obtained Fe-doped Co3O4@C has transformed into nanoparticles completely with a size of 30‒50 nm. It must be pointed out that the oxidant of KBrO3 plays an important role in the formation of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles. As comparison, the CoFe-LDH nanoplates were directly immersed in an aqueous glucose solution without KBrO3 for oxidation, and the glucose-coated CoFe-LDH nanoplates were calcined in N2 atmosphere to obtain the final product (namely FeCo3O4@C). Fig. S1 shows the XRD pattern of FeCo3O4@C, all the characteristic diffraction peaks were similar with Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles, which can be attributed to Co3O4, indicating that it can be fabricated Fe doped Co3O4 by calcination of CoFe-LDH directly. However, the FeCo3O4@C remained the nanoplate structure after calcination process (Fig. S2), confirming that the presence of KBrO3 is required for the formation of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles, and a possible mechanism for the formation of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles can be proposed as follows: in initial stage, with the effect of KBrO3, as strong oxidant, the Co(OH)2 was oxidized into Co3O4 seeds on the surface of CoFe-LDH; with time extension, the seeds grow up and BrO3− ions migrate into the interior of the CoFe-LDH nanoplates, resulting in a layered",

SEM images of (a) and(d) CoFe-LDH, (b) and(e) Fe-doped Co3O4, (c) and(f) Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles.\nMore detailed structure information about the products can be obtained by TEM tests (\nFig. 4\n). As shown in\nFig. 4\n(a), the CoFe-LDH has a nanosheet-shaped crystal structure, with a diameter of 80‒300 nm, and the nanoplates were nearly transparent to electron beams, indicating that the CoFe-LDH sample was ultrathin nanoplates.\nFig. 4\n(b) shows the morphology and structure of the Fe-doped Co3O4. It can be seen that there are many nanoparticles and nanoplates coexistence; indeed, the nanoplates also were composed of nanoparticles.\nFig. 4\n(c) shows TEM images of the resulting Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles, in which the size of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles was in average of 30‒50 nm. Furthermore, Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles have larger size than that of Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles, attributing to the sintering of Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles after carbon-coating. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM,\nFig. 4\n(d)) indicates the interplanar distance of 0.289 nm and 0.470 nm, slightly larger than that of Co3O4 (0.286 nm, 0.467 nm) because of the substitution of Fe for Co, assigned to the (220) and the (111) planes characteristic of Co3O4, respectively. The distribution of Co, Fe, O and C was further confirmed by the elemental distribution diagram (EDX) (\nFig. 5\n). The corresponding elemental mapping indicates that the Co, Fe and O elements are uniformly distributed within the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles (\nFig. 5\n(a)–(e)), further suggesting that we have successfully obtained Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles. The presence of elemental C, although the signal is weak, formed by decomposition of glucose, was also confirmed. ICP test (Table S1) shows that the CoFe-LDH and Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles have an overall Co/Fe molar ratio of 3.05 and 2.28, respectively.\nFig. 4. (a) TEM image of CoFe-LDH, (b) TEM images of Fe-doped Co3O4 (inset: HRTEM image), (c) and (d) TEM and HRTEM images of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles.\nFig. 5. (a) STEM image of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles for element analysis, (b)–(e) elemental mappings of C, Co, Fe and O, respectively.\nTo probe the valence state of the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles, XPS measurements were performed. Full XPS spectrum unambiguously indicates the existence of Co, Fe, O and C elements in the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles (Fig. S3), being consistent with EDX elemental mapping results. As shown in\nFig. 6\n(a), the deconvolution of the Co 2p profile was achieved by fitting to eight species. The peaks located at 779.2/794.3 eV, 781.4/796.9 eV and 780.2/795.5 eV, corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. The bond energies of the peaks are consistent with reported Co3O4\n[41]\n. Moreover, the XPS spectra of Fe–Co3O4@C nanosheet and Co3O4 have been done as comparison (Fig. S4).

Moreover, the XPS spectra of Fe–Co3O4@C nanosheet and Co3O4 have been done as comparison (Fig. S4). It can be calculated that the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ in the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles, Fe–Co3O4@C nanosheet and Co3O4 were 1.66, 1.42 and 1.15, respectively, indicating that there are more Co3+ in Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles, and benefited to the electrochemical performance. The Fe 2p XPS spectrum of the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles (\nFig. 6\n(b)) is fitted with two pairs of spin-orbit doublets and a satellite peak. The first doublet at 710.4 eV and 721.8 eV with the satellite peak at 717.4 eV can be assigned to the Fe2+, and the second doublet at 712.9 eV and 724.4 eV is attributed to Fe3+\n[42]\n. The O 1s peak can be deconvoluted into three peaks (\nFig. 6\n(c)). The peaks at 531.2 and 533.0 eV is attributed to oxygen in hydroxyl groups and absorbed water. The peak centered at 529.4 eV is associated with the typical lattice O2− in Co3O4. The C 1s XPS of the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles is presented in\nFig. 6\n(d). A primary peak appeared at 284.5 eV, which is related to the graphitic carbon peak.\nFig. 6. XPS spectra of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles. (a) Co 2p, (b) Fe 2p, (c) O 1s and (d) C 1s.\nThe atomic and electronic structure of the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles were also investigated by XANES and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The XANES spectrum of Co K-edge, as shown in\nFig. 7\n(a), exhibits that the absorption edge of the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles is positively shifted and the intensity of the peaks is obviously stronger than that of Co3O4, manifesting the higher average oxidation state of Co. Fourier transformed (FT) of the Co K-edge EXAFS spectrum is illustrated in\nFig. 7\n(b). The FTEXAFS spectrum of Co K-edge presents that Co in the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles shows a different atomic structure in comparison with that in Co3O4. It can be seen that the lower peak intensity at higher coordination shells, indicated that there are more trivalent cobalt (Co3+) active sites and cobalt vacancies in Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles, which improved the electrical conductivity and enhanced the OER performance.\nFig. 7. Co K-edge (a) XANES and (b) EXAFS spectra of Co3O4 and Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles.\nThe nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurement results of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles and FeCo3O4@C nanosheets are provided in\nFig. 8\n. Both the samples display the similar IV type isotherms, implying existence of mesoporous structure. The BET specific surface area of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles (34 m2 g−1) is higher than that of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanosheets (21 m2 g−1), displaying that Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles can offer the greater contact area and more active sites. Based on the BJH analysis (\nFig. 8\n, inset), the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles possess mesoporous structure with average pore size of 26 nm and a pore volume of 0.26 cm3 g−1. In contrast, the average pore size for FeCo3O4@C nanosheets was 7 nm with pore volume of 0.05 cm3 g−",

Based on the BJH analysis (\nFig. 8\n, inset), the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles possess mesoporous structure with average pore size of 26 nm and a pore volume of 0.26 cm3 g−1. In contrast, the average pore size for FeCo3O4@C nanosheets was 7 nm with pore volume of 0.05 cm3 g−1. As we know, the porous structure cannot only allow volume expansion during the continuous redox reaction, thus exposing catalytic active sites, but also facilitate OH− and electron fast diffusion, which resulted in well OER activity.\nFig. 8. (a) The isothermal curves of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles and (b) FeCo3O4@C nanosheets (the corresponding pore-size distribution plots were shown in insets).\nIn order to verify the OER activity, the as-synthesized Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles were first uniformly loaded onto foam nickel (loading ∼5 mg cm−2), and many related electrochemical tests are carried out using a general three-electrode system in alkaline medium (1 M KOH). For comparison, the electrocatalytic activity of other catalysts including Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles, FeCo3O4@C nanosheets, CoFe-LDH and pure Co3O4 was also measured under the identical conditions. The OER polarization curves without iR-compensation at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 show that the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles exhibited the earliest OER onset potential of 1.45 V (vs. RHE) (\nFig. 9\n(a)), which is much smaller than that of Fe-doped Co3O4 (1.51 V), FeCo3O4@C nanosheets (1.52 V), CoFe-LDH (1.50 V) and pure Co3O4 (1.56 V).\nFig. 9\n(c) lists the required overpotential of these catalysts to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm−2. Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode only requires an overpotential of 260 mV, which is lower than that of Fe-doped Co3O4 (293 mV), FeCo3O4@C nanosheet (296 mV), CoFe-LDH (266 mV) and pure Co3O4 (351 mV). Moreover, compared with most of the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts, Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles exhibit excellent OER activity (Table S2). The catalytic kinetics of the above catalysts was also carefully demonstrated by the corresponding Tafel slopes (\nFig. 9\n(b)). The Tafel slope of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode is only 70 mV dec−1, which is much smaller than that of all other investigated catalysts including Fe-doped Co3O4 (97 mV dec−1), FeCo3O4@C nanosheet (103 mV dec−1), CoFe-LDH (152 mV dec−1) and pure Co3O4 (124 mV dec−1). It can be noted that a lower Tafel slope of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode corresponds to more effective catalytic kinetics, which leads to high OER activity. The long-term stability of electrocatalyst is of great importance for energy conversion systems. The stability for the OER was carried out by current–time curve method at 1.50 V (vs. RHE) for Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode and at 1.53 V for Fe-doped Co3O4 electrode in alkaline solution (1 M KOH) (\nFig. 9\n(d)). For the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode, the i–t curve shows only a little degradation (less than 7%) even after a long period of 100 h OER test, suggesting an excellent stability for OER. In addition, the polarization curve presents the nearly same OER activity before and after life-test of 40 h as shown in Fig. S5, further demonstrating a well stability for the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode. In contrast, the current density of Fe-doped Co3O4 electrode decreased remarkably, indicating a poor OER activity",

In contrast, the current density of Fe-doped Co3O4 electrode decreased remarkably, indicating a poor OER activity. It can be explained that the presence of the ultrathin carbon layer not only enhances the conductivity but also can improve the stability of catalysts by protecting catalytic particles from the erosion of electrolyte.\nFig. 9.

(d) Current–time curves obtained for water oxidation reaction in the presence of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode at 1.50 V (vs. RHE) and Fe-doped Co3O4 electrode at 1.53 V.\nTo further investigate the kinetics of as-fabricated catalysts in OER process, the ECSA and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are performed. The ECSAs that proportionally show the amount of active sites for OER\n[43]\n, were estimated by measuring the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) derived from the cyclic voltammogram (\nFig. 10\n(a)–(d)).\nFig. 10\n(e) shows that the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode delivers the largest Cdl value (4.85 mF cm−2) in comparison with FeCo3O4@C nanosheet (2.65 mF cm−2), Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticle (2.06 mF cm−2) and pure Co3O4 (3.80 mF cm−2) electrodes, which reveals that Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode possesses the largest effective ECSA. These results indicate the enriched active sites and enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode for OER. Furthermore, it is noted that the semicircle diameter in the EIS (\nFig. 10\n(f)) of Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode is much smaller than that of the FeCo3O4@C nanosheet, Fe-doped Co3O4 nanoparticle, CoFe-LDH and pure Co3O4 electrodes, indicating a higher conductivity for the Fe-doped Co3O4@C electrode. In addition, the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle electrode display a well electrochemical activity than that of FeCo3O4@C nanosheet, which can be attributed that the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticle has larger surface area, much more abundant mesoporous and larger effective ECSA.\nFig. 10.

With combination of many factors, Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles display an excellent OER performance with a small overpotential of 260 mV at the current density of 20 mA/cm2 and long-term durability (there was no obviously OER current density degradation for 100 h) in alkaline solution. In view of the cost-effectiveness, simple, reliable fabrication method and outstanding catalytic performance, the Fe-doped Co3O4@C nanoparticles may hold great potential in fuel cell and metal–air battery as energy conversion and storage devices. We hope this work could provide a new strategy for the design of excellent electrocatalysts.\nThis work was supported by the 973 Program (no. 2014CB932104), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos:\n2177060378, U1707603 and 21521005\n) and the Program for Changjiang Scholars, Innovative Research Teams in Universities (no.
