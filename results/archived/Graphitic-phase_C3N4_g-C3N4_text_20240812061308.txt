  "0": "1 Introduction\nEfficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode has become one of the most challenging tasks for various energy devices including fuel cells and metal–air batteries. (1, 2) To date, Pt-based materials are still the most widely used catalysts, even though their further application is limited because of their high cost, limited stability, poor tolerance to methanol, and sluggish kinetics. (3-5) Great efforts have been devoted to developing highly active catalysts for ORR with comparable activity to Pt, but with higher durability and lower cost, including Pt-based alloys, (6-8) transition-metal catalysts, (9-11) and carbon-based nanomaterials. (12-20) Notably, carbon-based materials are considered as promising catalysts because of their low cost, environmental friendliness, high electrocatalytic selectivity, and good durability. (21-25)\nDoping of heteroatoms such as N into carbon-based materials significantly contributed to the better selectivity for ORR because the N atom with five valence electrons could easily shift the neutrally charged adjacent carbon atoms and create positively charged sites, favoring O2 adsorption and reduction. (26-30) The catalytic activity of N-doped carbon is affected by the pH value of the electrolytes, four-electron pathway is more favorable in alkaline electrolytes as compared to acidic electroytes. (31, 32) In general, N-doped carbon-based materials are prepared mainly by two methods: postdoping (26, 27, 32-34) and in situ direct-doping. (21-23) However, these pathways have obvious disadvantages including low efficiency, residual metallic impurity, and requirement of multiple organic precursors. (22, 32) The postdoping method usually involves a chemical pretreatment with HNO3, NH3, or HCN to introduce the N atom, which may lead to a poor control over the chemical homogeneity, reproducibility, and crystal structure. (32, 35) Therefore, it is urgent to develop a green, highly efficient, and environmentally benign route to synthesize N-doped carbon-based materials with high ORR catalytic activity. Notably, even with great effort toward the ORR origin, the nature of catalytic sites has been heavily debated because of the following two technological barriers: (1) N-doping level and type are varied significantly depending on the synthesis conditions; and (2) in most cases, an inevitable operation to remove the template or activate the samples using potassium hydroxide deteriorates the crystallinity of the samples, thwarting the attempts to get an unambiguous understanding of the catalytic nature. (32, 36, 37) Thus, the development of a synthesis route for metal-free N-doped carbon materials that can both exhibit superior activity toward ORR and reveal the nature of catalytic sites is highly desired. In a recent study, we synthesized graphene/graphene-tube nanocomposites derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as highly efficient ORR catalysts, particularly for nonaqueous Li–O2 battery cathodes, (38) but metal impurities were still present.\nMetal-free graphitic-phase C3N4 (g-C3N4), a semiconductor with a band gap of ∼2.64 eV, (39) has received increasing attention owing to its potential application in ORR, (40) photocatalysis, (19, 41-44) bioimaging, (45, 46) etc. Carbon nitride (like CNx, g-C3N4) shows reasonably good ORR activity in acidic medium, but its poor electrical conductivity hampers its widespread applications in PEMFCs. (28) In particular, because of its high N content, g-C3N4 was often used as the N source to synthesize N-doped materials or incorporate into mesoporous or conductive carbon as the potential candidate for ORR. (47) It is therefore of great interest to explore the possibility of utilizing this novel framework that only contains carbon and nitrogen elements to synthesize N-doped carbon materials. The unique crystal structure with no other metal impurity element makes it an ideal self-sacrificing template to synthesize N-doped graphene-like carbon materials. (47) However, unsuccessful control over the heat treatment process of g-C3N4 usually leads to gaseous components (C2N2+,C3N2+, N2 etc.) as the final products. (48, 49) Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, a novel one-pot strategy to synthesize N-doped graphene through a direct transformation from bulk",

(48, 49) Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, a novel one-pot strategy to synthesize N-doped graphene through a direct transformation from bulk g-C3N4. The as-prepared N-doped graphene exhibited excellent catalytic activity for ORR, which is comparable to the commercial Pt/C (20 wt %, E-TEK), but with even better stability and lower cost. The direct transformation from g-C3N4 to N-doped graphene may provide new insight for the design and synthesis of nonprecious metal catalyst, and help to reveal the ORR catalytic nature of N-doped carbon materials.\n2 Experimental Section\n2.1 Synthesis of N-Doped Graphene\nThe g-C3N4 was synthesized following a procedure described in a previous report. (42) In detail, the as-purchased melamine (99.99%, Alfa Aesar) was heated at 600 °C for 4 h in a conventional tube furnace under a high-purity Ar (99.999%) flow of 50 standard-state cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) with a ramp rate of 2.3 °C/min. Next, 2 g of the as-prepared g-C3N4 powder was placed in a quartz tube (20 cm × Φ 1.8 cm) with one terminal open. Then, a quartz plug (5 cm × Φ 1.7 cm) was inserted from the open side. After that, the configured quartz tube was placed in a conventional tube furnace, and the open side was placed at the downstream. The furnace was heated to 730–790 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C/min under a high-purity argon (99.9999%) flow of 100 sccm. The annealing was performed in tube furnace at 800–1000 °C for 2 h at a ramp rate of 5 °C/min under a high-purity N2 (99.999%) flow of 50 sccm.\n2.2 Characterization\nSEM images were recorded on a Hitachi SU8020 scanning electron microscope. XRD measurements were performed on a Rigaku D/max 2500 X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation). TEM images, energy-dispersive EDX spectra, and elemental mapping were collected on a JEM-2100F. X-ray photoelectron spectra were recorded on an ESCALAB MKII using Mg Kα as the excitation source. The ICP measurements were conducted on a PerkinElmer Optima 3300DV inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer for elemental analysis. Raman spectra were collected on an HR 800 using a 633 nm laser. FT-IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer spectrometer in the range 4000–400 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas were measured by nitrogen adsorption–desorption analyses using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020.\n2.3 Electrochemical Measurements\nAll the electrochemical measurements were carried out using a CHI 650 D potentiostat in a conventional three-electrode cell using Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) and a platinum wire as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The as-prepared catalysts were dispersed in a mixture of water, ethanol, and Nafion (5%) (volume ratio = 1:1:0.2) to form a 4 mg mL–1 suspension. An RDE with a glassy carbon disk (3.0 mm in diameter) served as the substrate of the working electrode for evaluating the ORR activity and selectivity of various catalysts. The loading of catalyst is calculated to be about 20 μg on the electrode surface. Before use, the glassy carbon electrodes in RDE were polished using aqueous alumina suspension. For comparison, a 4 mg mL–1 Pt/C suspension (20 wt %, E-TEK) was also prepared following the same procedure as described above. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of different catalysts were performed in an Ar/O2-saturated KOH (0.1 M) solution in the potential range of 0 and 1.2 V vs RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s–",

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of different catalysts were performed in an Ar/O2-saturated KOH (0.1 M) solution in the potential range of 0 and 1.2 V vs RHE at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1. The electrochemical activity was measured in a common flow cell reactor using the RDE technique. In our work, the onset potential of these samples is defined as the potential at the current density of 0.1 mA cm–2.\n3 Results and Discussion\nDirect transformation from g-C3N4 to N-doped graphene was carried out under Ar atmosphere, as shown in Scheme S1 (the experimental configuration is shown in Figure S1). In a previous study, it is generally accepted that g-C3N4 will be decomposed completely to gaseous products above 750 °C, but N-doped graphene can be prepared with the assistance of glucose. (47) However, oxygen-containing groups are inevitably present in the N-doped graphene by using the glucose as the starting material, which hinders the further investigation of the role of N for ORR. Here, we demonstrate that g-C3N4 can be directly transformed into N-doped graphene via a modified solid-state reaction (see the Experimental Section for details). Briefly, the precursor of bulk g-C3N4 was placed in a one-terminal closed quartz tube coordinated with a quartz plug (see Scheme S1 and Figure S1) in a tube furnace. Under this controlled process, N-doped graphene with a high yield of ∼76–78% (calculated based on the carbon obtained from g-C3N4) was obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure 1a) of the as-obtained g-C3N4 shows the typical diffraction peaks of g-C3N4 (The International Centre for Diffraction Data, ICDD-PDF-4+, card no. 01-078-1747, space group R3m) located at ∼12.8° and ∼26.9°, corresponding to the lattice planes parallel to the c-axis and (002) plane, respectively. With the increase in temperature from 700 to 720 °C (Figure 1a), the diffraction peak at ∼12.8° gradually disappeared, and the intensity of the peak at ∼26.9° also decreased remarkably. In NG730 (the product synthesized at 730 °C), a broad peak appeared at ∼24.7°, indicating a successful transformation from g-C3N4 into carbon materials with a low degree of graphitization. This conversion was further confirmed by Raman spectra (Figure S2) and FT-IR spectra (Figure 1b). The characteristic Raman peaks at 705, 746, 975, 1231, and 1310 cm–1 of g-C3N4 agree well with the previous report. (50) After the controlled heat treatment, typical G band (∼1580 cm –1) and D band (∼1347 cm –1) of carbon materials were observed, a convincing evidence confirming the successful transformation from g-C3N4 to carbon materials at 730 °C. (51, 52) In Figure 1b, the FT-IR spectrum of raw g-C3N4 have several strong bands in the range of 1200–1650 cm–1, with the peaks at ∼1241, 1406, and 1571 cm–1 corresponding to the typical stretching modes of CN heterocycles. (53) Additionally, the characteristic breathing mode of triazine units at 806 cm–1 was observed. (50, 53) Below 730 °C, all samples show the similar FT-IR spectrum compared with g-C3N4. After heated at 730 °C, the C═N bonding (∼1600 cm –1) and C—N bonding (∼1300 cm –1) of nitrogen are clearly formed. (54) In addition, the first-principles calculations also suggest that this transformation is favorable in energy (Figures S3 and S4). Corresponding to the structure transition, SEM (Figure 2a, Figure S5) and TEM images (Figure 2b, Figure S6) exhibited a clear morphological evolution from a dense solid (g-C3N4) to loose agglomerates (carbon materials).

Corresponding to the structure transition, SEM (Figure 2a, Figure S5) and TEM images (Figure 2b, Figure S6) exhibited a clear morphological evolution from a dense solid (g-C3N4) to loose agglomerates (carbon materials). The ring-like mode in the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Figure 2b) confirms that at this stage the as-prepared carbon materials are amorphous in nature. However, a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 2c) clearly shows that NG730 is graphene with 4–6 layers. The scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image in Figure 2d displays that N element (inset of Figure 2d) is homogeneously distributed in NG730, and this carbon material is highly doped by N. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis shows a high surface area of ∼750 m2 g–1 for NG730 (Figure S7).\nFigure 1\nFigure 1.

(d) Scanning TEM image of the NG730 and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry elemental maps of C and N (inset in panel d), respectively.\nN-Doped carbon materials have been widely studied as efficient ORR electrocatalysts. (21, 33) However, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements performed in 0.1 M KOH indicate that the ORR performance of NG730 is very limited (Figure S8), probably owing to the low graphitic degree and incomplete reconstruction of the carbon framework under the current heat treatment conditions. To improve the ORR performance, the as-prepared NG730 was further annealed at higher temperatures (800–1000 °C at an interval of 50 °C, denoted as NGA800, NGA850, etc.) to tune both the graphitization degree and N content. NGA800-NGA1000 showed almost same XRD patterns (Figure 3a). However, the ID/IG band intensity ratio in Raman spectra (Figure 3b) decreased from ∼1.1 (NG730) to ∼0.84 (NGA1000), indicating that the graphitization degree has been significantly improved with increased annealing temperature. (51, 55) The annealed samples have similar sheet features (Figure 4a, Figure S9), with loose agglomerates with sizes of several micrometers. AFM imaging of NGA900 (Figure 4b) directly proves the layer structure of the sheets with a layer thickness between 0.39 and 1.02 nm, matching well with the thickness of mono and few-layer graphene, respectively.\nFigure 3\nFigure 3. (a) XRD patterns and (b) Raman spectra of NG730 and annealed samples.\nFigure 4\nFigure 4. (a) SEM, (b) AFM image of NGA900 and corresponding height measurements (c, d).\nThe chemical bonding of the samples during the annealing process was evaluated by FT-IR spectroscopy (Figure S10). The NGA samples showed similar spectra to NG730. After annealed, the relative intensity of both C═N bonds (∼1592 cm –1) and C—N bonds (∼1250 cm –1) gradually decreased, (22) indicating the decreased total N content in NGA samples. To explore further the N content and species, the chemical structure of the resulting N-doped graphene was elucidated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 5a and Figure S11). As can be seen, the N 1s spectrum could be fitted into two peaks at the binding energies of ∼398.6 and 401.1 eV, corresponding to the pyridinic-N (N1), and graphitic-N (N2), respectively. (56, 57) The absence of another typical N species, pyrrolic-N, has been reported to be related to the experimental conditions and the precursor.

(56, 57) The absence of another typical N species, pyrrolic-N, has been reported to be related to the experimental conditions and the precursor. (32) Distinctly, the shape of these two peaks changed significantly depending on the annealing temperature, indicating a tremendous variety of the relative content of N1 and N2. Relative ratios of the N content are displayed in Figure 5b,c. In NG730, N1 (20.9%) is more prevalent than N2 (9.5%). With increase in the annealing temperature, the total N content decreased dramatically. The N1 (N2) content decreased slowly from 4.3% (4.3%) in NGA800 to 4.2% (3.1%) in NGA850, 3.5% (1.9%) in NGA900, and 2.4% (1.5%) in NGA950. Notably, in NGA1000, only N2 (0.9%) could be distinguished, an indication that only graphitic-N is present in this sample. With increase in the annealing temperature, the ratio of graphitic-N/pyridinic-N (N2/N1) increased significantly to the highest value of ∼1.84 for NGA900 (see Figure 5b). This result indicates that during the annealing process, the reconstruction of the carbon framework was accompanied by the variation of N species, and the relative content of different N species can be tuned by controlling the annealing temperature, which might greatly influence the electrocatalytic performances of these N-doped graphene materials.\nFigure 5\nFigure 5. (a) High-resolution N 1s XPS spectra of the as-prepared samples. (b) Content change and ratio of graphitic-N/pyridinic-N of different samples. (c) Graphitic-N, pyridinic-N, and total N contents of different samples.\nThe electrocatalytic activities were evaluated by CV measurements in 0.1 M KOH solution saturated with O2 or N2 at a scanning rate of 50 mV s–1. As shown in Figure 6a, Figure S12 and Figure S13, all the annealed samples show no peak in N2 saturated solution but an obvious reduction peak in O2-saturated solution. As the annealed temperature increased, the reduction peak beceme more postive except the NGA950 and NGA1000, indicating that the ORR catalytic activity was improved. Taking NGA900 as a typical sample, the CV for NGA900 showed a nearly rectangular shape, indicating high conductivity with superior capacitive current. Although a featureless CV in the potential range from 0 to 1.2 V vs RHE was observed in a N2-saturated solution (Figure 6a). In contrast, a well-defined CV peak (Epeak) due to O2 reduction, centered at 0.795 V vs RHE, can be seen in O2-saturated solution. Next, to further evaluate the electrocatalytic activity, the N-doped graphene synthesized under different reaction conditions and commercial Pt/C in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH(aq) were analyzed by LSV using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) (Figure 4b and Figures S12–S14) at 1600 rpm. We can observe from Figure 6b that with increasing annealing temperature, the limiting current density is increased except for NGA950 and NGA1000. Among all N-doped graphene samples, NGA900 has the highest limiting current density of about 4.6 mA cm–2 (at 0.365 V vs RHE), which is comparable to commercial Pt/C (4.63 mA cm–2). The above results reveal that catalytic activity is closely dependent on the annealing temperature, or to say relative content of graphitic-N and pyridinic-N (Figure 5b). As compared with the poor ORR performance of NG730 (Epeak = 0.555 V vs RHE), with the increase in the annealing temperature, the onset potential and Epeak became more positive, and the current density increases significantly, indicating enhanced ORR catalytic activity. Among them, NGA900 provides the best performance toward ORR, and the onset potential is determined to be ca. 0.914 V vs RHE, which is close to ca. 0.944 V vs RHE identified from commercial Pt/C",

The NGA900 sample presents a nearly equal ORR activity to Pt/C catalysts in terms of half-wave potential (E1/2) (0.828 V vs RHE and 0.85 V vs RHE for NGA900 and Pt/C, respectively). Recently, carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts with low cost, good durability and various structure including porous carbon, carbon nanotube and graphene attract more and more interest due to the improved ORR activity. (25) For example, Parvez et al. synthesized the N-doped graphene with the E1/2 of ∼0.775 V vs RHE, and found that the incorporation of Fe into N-doped graphene could signicifantly improve the ORR activity. (58) Ye et al. demonstrated the nitrogen-doped carbon with an improved E1/2 of about 0.80 V vs RHE, (21) obtained by calcination of a mixture of urea and bacterial cellulose. Next, Qu et al. synthesized N-doped graphene by CVD with an E1/2 of ∼0.6 V vs RHE and pointed out that the role of N-doping in graphene is important to ORR enhancement. (56) Li et al. developed an electrochemical approach to luminescent and electrocatalytically active N-doped graphene quantum dots with an E1/2 of ∼0.8 V vs RHE. (59) Chen et al. developed N-doped graphene/carbon nanotube nanocomposite by a hydrothermal process with an E1/2 of ∼0.73 V vs RHE. (60) He et al. developed three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous N-doped carbon catalysts, which exhibited excellent catalytic avtivity with an E1/2 of about 0.83 V vs HRE. (22) However, the complicated manipulation process still hindered their further application. (22) To the best of our knowledge, such one-pot direct transformation from graphitic C3N4 to nitrogen-doped graphene with high ORR activity has not yet been reported until this work, which has good activities comparable to Pt/C for metal-free N-doped carbon-based catalyst with an E1/2 of about 0.828 V vs RHE. Importantly, this synthesis strategy provides a chance to investigate the nature of catalytic sites for ORR in a “clean” binary system with only carbon and nitrogen elements, and no other elements were detected via XPS and ICP analysis, revealing the metal-free nature of NGA samples.\nFigure 6\nFigure 6.

To gain further insight into the ORR kinetics, the kinetic current density (Jk) was analyzed based on the RDE tests with various rotating speeds (ω) (Figure 6c). By using the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation, (61, 62) the number of electron transfers (n) per O2 molecule involved in the ORR can be determined (inset of Figure 6c). The straight and parallel fitted curves suggest a first-order reaction with the dissolved oxygen on NGA900 from 0.57 to 0.72 V vs RHE. From the slopes of the K–L plots in Figure 6c, the n per O2 molecule in ORR was calculated to be 3.9 for NGA900 (at 0.365 V vs RHE), indicating a one-step four-electron reduction pathway to produce water as the main product, which will benefit the construction of fuel cells with high efficiency. To shed light on the intrinsic advantage of this novel structure, the Tafel plots for ORR on various electrodes derived from Figure 6c and Figures S12 and S13, are shown in Figure 6d and Figure S15. To compare fairly and accurately the catalytic activity of the annealed samples, the polarization measurements and subsequent Tafel analysis for these iR losses were corrected by the use of the series resistance (Rs), which is determined from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy as shown in Figure S16. The Tafel plots exhibit two distinct linear regions at both the low and high overpotential regions, and the corresponding Tafel slope values are shown in Figure S17. In the low overpotentical region (>0.865 V vs RHE), the samples give a Tafel slope of ∼80 mV dec–1 (∼78 mV dec–1 after iR correction), slightly smaller than that of Pt/C catalysts (92 mV dec–1, ∼75 mV dec–1 after iR correction), confirming that the ORR activity is dominated by the kinetics of the surface reactions in the low overpotential region. (63) In the higher overpotential range (<0.815 V vs RHE), where the reaction speed is controlled by the diffusion limitation, the Tafel slopes exhibited a relatively stable increase to 91 mV dec–1 (∼83 mV dec–1 after iR correction). As compared to the sharp increase in the Tafel slopes in previously reported metal-free samples, (64) this study shows excellent mass-transfer properties. As shown in Figure 6e and Table S1, an increase in n from 3.2 (NG730) to 3.9 (NGA900) was observed. With the increase in the annealing temperature from 800 to 1000 °C, the kinetic current density (Jk, at 0.365 V vs RHE) keeps at a relatively low value except for NGA900 (Figure 6e). A highest current density of ∼29.3 mA cm–2 was observed for NGA900, which is even superior to that of the commercial Pt/C (23.7 mA cm–2) under the same testing conditions, further indicating the unique properties of NGA900. Considering the potential applications of NGA900 as effective ORR catalysts by replacing the commercial Pt/C, the electrochemical stability was also investigated.\nThe NGA900 showed a better long-term durability than the commercial Pt/C. As shown in Figure 6f, after 35 000 s of reaction at 0.715 V vs RHE, 86% of the current density toward ORR can be maintained for NGA900, which is much higher than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (33%). Owing to the involvement of metal-free direct transformation, different electrocatalytic activities of the as-prepared N-doped graphene for ORR can be attributed exclusively to the total contents of N and relative ratio of various N species. However, with respect to the nature of catalytic sites in the metal-free catalysts for ORR, inconsistencies are still present. (27, 33, 34, 65, 66) For instance, Xing et al. reported that presence of pyridinic-N species on the edge of N-doped graphene is very important for ORR. (33) Conversely, some studies have proved the effect of graphitic N for ORR. (61, 66) Very recently, He et al. demonstrated that both pyrrolic- and pyrid",

(27, 33, 34, 65, 66) For instance, Xing et al. reported that presence of pyridinic-N species on the edge of N-doped graphene is very important for ORR. (33) Conversely, some studies have proved the effect of graphitic N for ORR. (61, 66) Very recently, He et al. demonstrated that both pyrrolic- and pyridinic-N are less effective ORR catalytic sites in 3D hierarchically porous N-doped carbons. (22) Lai et al. reported that the electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst was strongly dependent on the graphitic N content, which determined the limiting current density, whereas the pyridinic-N content improved the onset potential for ORR, suggesting that both graphitic- and pyridinic-N could help the ORR peformance. (67) However, they also pointed out that the total N content in the graphene-based nonprecious metal catalyst did not play an important role in determining the ORR property. These conflicting results have attracted great interest because of its great importance in the design of advanced metal-free ORR catalysts. Moreover, it is difficult to identify the role of pyridinic-N that bonds to a metal cation by forming coordination complexes, because its catalytic activity will be affected by the controversial role of metallic impurities. (21) By contrast, our study offers one significant advantage that using the metal-free precursor containing only carbon and nitrogen elements to synthesize the N-doped graphene as electrocatalysts, which may enable us to obtain further insight on the catalytic nature of N-doped carbons for ORR. To get more insight into the ORR performance, the electrical conductivity was first measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as shown in Figure S16. It is well accepted that a high electrical conductivity is a prime requirement for ORR catalysts. (22, 32) Obviously, the NGA samples exhibited improved electrical conductivity than NG730. NGA900 showed better electrical conductivity than NGA850 and NGA 800, partly explaining its high ORR catalytic activity. Compared to NGA950, better ORR performance with less electrical conductivity observed in NGA900 also implies that the electrical conductivity is not the determining factor for the nature of catalytic sites. As a proof, pure carbon was subjected to the ORR tests under the same experimental conditions, and no obvious ORR electrocatalytic activity was observed. In our work, the onset potential and limiting current are improved as the annealing temperature increased except for NGA1000, which means that only appropriate amount of graphitic and pyridinic-N is beneficial for the ORR. On the basis of the XPS analysis, the NGA900 sample shows the highest ratio of graphitic-N/pyridinic-N at a relatively low total N content. It is reasonable to conclude that the increase in electrocatalytic activity can be attributed to the increased ratio of graphitic-N/pyridinic-N as well as a proper total N content.\n4 Conclusions\nWe have demonstrated a simple and cost-effective approach for the synthesis of N-doped graphene via a direct transformation process. Our synthesis strategy offers a chance to investigate the nature of catalytic sites for ORR in a “clean” binary system, with only carbon and nitrogen elements. The electrochemical tests in combination with XPS analysis proved that the high electrocatalytic activity could be attributed to the improved graphitization degree, high ratio of graphitic-N/pyridinic-N, and proper total content of N. This study may help to elucidate the nature of catalytic sites in metal-free N-doped carbon materials, which is very important for catalyst design and property modulation. Superior ORR performance with good durability rendered the as-prepared N-doped graphene a promising candidate to replace the commercial Pt/C for practical applications.\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acsami.5b03845.\nExperimental section, schematic illustration of the synthesis of N-doped graphene from g-C3N4, optical images of the semi-closed quartz tube consisted of C3N4 before and after heated at 730° C and optical images of the g-C3N4 (0.1 g) heated at different temperature, Raman spectra of NG730 and g-C3N4 using a 633 nm laser as the excitation source, total DOS of atom C5, N14, and N16 for C",
