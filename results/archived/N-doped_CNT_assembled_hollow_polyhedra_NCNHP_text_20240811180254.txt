Here, we firstly report a simple KCl-assisted pyrolysis strategy to construct hybrid architectures with Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanotube hollow polyhedra (NCNHP) by using ZIF-67 as the precursor. The presence of KCl accelerates the decomposition of ZIF-67 and promotes the in situ formation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) during the pyrolysis at temperatures as low as 400 °C. The optimal NCNHP-1-500 with a CNT-assembled hierarchical architecture and abundant Co–Nx active sites exhibits excellent OER activity when benchmarked with commercial IrO2, achieving a needed overpotential of only 310 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. NCNHP-1-500 also displays satisfactory ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.828 V vs. RHE that is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (20 wt% Pt), and superior methanol tolerance and stability to Pt/C. The KCl-assisted pyrolysis strategy might bring new opportunities to fabricate novel hybrid architectures for highly efficient bifunctional OER and ORR electrocatalysts.', 'Introduction': 'Great efforts have been dedicated to fabricating noble-metal-free catalysts for OER and ORR, such as carbon materials,12–15 transition metal oxides,16–18 hydroxides,19–21 sulfides,11,22,23 and their composite materials.24–27 Among them, transition metal–nitrogen–carbon (TM–N–C) materials have been regarded as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for OER and ORR.28–30 The doped N atoms forming chemical bonds with transition metal nanoparticles are able to modify the electronic structures and optimize the adsorption of intermediates, beneficial for enhancing the oxygen electrochemical processes.31–35 However, traditional synthesis strategies for TM–N–C materials always initiate with heterogeneous composites which are difficult to distribute uniformly. Moreover, the subsequent high-temperature carbonization usually causes severe aggregation of metal nanoparticles. These tedious synthetic procedures are disadvantageous for the rational design of precise architectures with well-defined morphologies and pore sizes for enhancing OER and ORR activity.36–39\\nRecently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted worldwide attention by virtue of abundant metal/organic species, tailorable morphologies and tunable porosities.40–46 The carbonization of N-rich zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) as precursors or templates has been proven to be a feasible method to produce TM–N–C materials with unique porous architectures.47–51 For example, Wang et al. reported a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst with a core–shell structure obtained from carbonization of ZIF-8@ZIF-67 at 800 °C.52 Significantly, in situ grown N-doped CNT materials derived from ZIFs always possess hierarchically porous structures and enhanced electron transport capacity, which favor oxygen electrochemical reactions. For instance, Lou et al. reported a N-doped CNT constructed framework with excellent electrocatalytic activity through high-temperature (over 700 °C) pyrolysis of ZIF-67 in the presence of H2.53 Wang et al. synthesized N-doped CNTs encapsulating Co nanoparticles (Co–N-CNTs) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst via direct pyrolysis of 2D Zn/Co-ZIF at a high temperature (900 °C) in Ar.54 In spite of the great advancement of synthesis strategies, high-temperature pyrolysis is still the critical synthetic condition for designing N-doped CNT structures from MOFs. The high cost and high energy consumption are disadvantageous for their large-scale applications. Additionally, the high-temperature treatment always leads to inevitable aggregation of nanoparticles and loss of nitrogen content, further restricting the electrocatalytic activity. Very recently, Mai et al. developed a low-temperature and slow pyrolysis strategy to obtain N-CNTs from ZIF-67 under an inert atmosphere (435 °C, 8 h). However, the time-consuming pyrolysis and the subsequent heating treatment at a high temperature (i.e., 700 °C) for better performance are still unsatisfactory.55 Therefore",

Very recently, Mai et al. developed a low-temperature and slow pyrolysis strategy to obtain N-CNTs from ZIF-67 under an inert atmosphere (435 °C, 8 h). However, the time-consuming pyrolysis and the subsequent heating treatment at a high temperature (i.e., 700 °C) for better performance are still unsatisfactory.55 Therefore, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize MOF-derived N-doped CNT structures with well-defined morphologies and excellent oxygen electrocatalytic activities by using a low-cost and facile synthetic procedure.\\nHerein, we report a novel low-temperature and KCl-assisted thermolysis strategy (Scheme 1) to fabricate N-doped CNT assembled hollow polyhedra (NCNHP). The presence of KCl accelerates the decomposition of ZIF-67 at a temperature as low as 400 °C. During the pyrolysis process, the first yielded Co nanoparticles catalyze the organic units in ZIF-67 to in situ grow CNTs. The optimized NCNHP material prepared at 500 °C possesses a morphology-preserved CNT-assembled architecture, in which Co nanoparticles are encapsulated within the top of the N-doped CNTs. The hierarchically porous structure and well-dispersed active Co–Nx moieties could provide more reaction zones and electron transfer pathways. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between Co nanoparticles and N-doped CNTs, as well as the unique hierarchical structure, NCNHP can serve as an excellent OER/ORR bifunctional catalyst, exhibiting superior electroactivity and durability when benchmarked with commercial IrO2 for OER and Pt/C for ORR under the same testing conditions.', 'Results and discussion': 'Synthesis and characterization of the catalysts\\nSubsequently, the as-prepared ZIF-67 was carbonized in the presence of KCl under H2/Ar. Typically, NCNHP-1-500 was prepared with a 1:1 mass ratio of KCl:ZIF-67 at 500 °C. SEM (Fig. 1a and S2†) and TEM (Fig. 1b) images indicate that NCNHP-1-500 possesses a hollow and hierarchical polyhedral structure with similar sizes to the pristine ZIF-67. Numerous slender CNTs with 100–200 nm in length are covered on the rough surface. Additionally, we can observe that the outer diameters of these CNTs range from 15 to 20 nm and the inner diameters are about 5 nm (Fig. 1c). The TEM image also reveals that the nanoparticles on the top of the CNTs are encapsulated by a few layered carbon shells. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images show that the interplanar spacing of the small graphitic layers existing in both multiwalled CNTs and carbon shells is 0.34 nm, which is assigned to the C (002) plane (Fig. 1d and e). It is noteworthy that the graphitic layers in the CNT walls are not entirely parallel to the axis direction of the CNTs, suggesting the exposure of considerable defects and edges, which are favorable for the enhanced electrocatalytic activity.56 In addition, the nanoparticles encapsulated on the top of the CNTs exhibit an interplanar spacing of ∼0.20 nm, in good agreement with the (111) plane of fcc metallic Co. During the pyrolysis treatment, the Co nanoparticles are formed preferentially on the surface and then catalyze the in situ formation of CNTs from inside to outside, ultimately leading to inner hollow voids and the morphology-preserved CNT-assembled architecture.57 Obviously, the Co nanoparticles on the top of CNTs and the open voids are able to afford available mass transfer pathways and more accessible reaction zones for the surface reactions.\\nHigh-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping (Fig. 1f) images of NCNHP-1-500 indicate that C, N and Co are distributed evenly over the sample. Furthermore, three peaks at around 44°, 51°, and 75° can be clearly observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. S3a†), corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of metallic Co (PDF no. 15-0806), respectively.

  "2": "f) images of NCNHP-1-500 indicate that C, N and Co are distributed evenly over the sample. Furthermore, three peaks at around 44°, 51°, and 75° can be clearly observed in the XRD pattern (Fig. S3a†), corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of metallic Co (PDF no. 15-0806), respectively. The nitrogen adsorption of NCNHP-1-500 exhibits a typical type-IV isotherm. The pronounced hysteresis loop verifies the formation of mesoporous structures (Fig. S3b†). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of NCNHP-1-500 is calculated to be 152 m2 g−1.\\nTo get further insight into the morphological and structural evolution of NCNHPs, the KCl/ZIF-67 composites with a mass ratio of 1:1 were pyrolyzed at different temperatures. All the obtained materials (named as NCNHP-1-T) show characteristic XRD peaks similar to NCNHP-1-500. The intensity of the peaks increases with an increase in the carbonization temperature (Fig. S4†), which may result from the aggregation of Co nanoparticles.58 The two peaks around 1350 and 1600 cm−1 in the Raman spectra correspond to the D band (defective carbon) and G band (graphitic carbon), respectively (Fig. S5a†). The slightly increasing band intensity ratio of ID/IG from NCNHP-1-400 to NCNHP-1-700 reveals a higher degree of defects in the materials obtained at higher temperatures. To be specially noted, the nitrogen content of NCNHP-1-500 is measured to be 3.27 wt% by elemental analysis (Table S1†), higher than that of other NCNHP-1-Ts. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of NCNHP-1-Ts show similar type IV isotherms (Fig. S5b†). A slight loss of specific surface area with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature can be observed (Table S1†), which may be due to the complete decomposition of the framework. To our delight, the unique CNT assembled hollow polyhedra can be fabricated at a temperature as low as 400 °C. However, the formed CNTs in NCNHP-1-400 are pretty short, and a few ultrathin carbon sheets can be seen on the surface, which might be due to the incomplete pyrolysis and insufficient growth of CNTs (Fig. S6†). Increasing the temperature to 500 °C led to a more complete pyrolysis process, and an observable hollow cavity and CNTs were obtained in NCNHP-1-500. Although NCNHP-1-600 (Fig. S7†) and NCNHP-1-700 (Fig. S8†) generate CNT structures, it is difficult for them to retain the intact morphology. In addition, cobalt nanoparticles are inclined to agglomerate at higher pyrolysis temperatures, which is disadvantageous for the formation of slender CNTs.\\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the detailed chemical composition and the electronic states of Co and N doped in the obtained NCNHP-1-Ts. The full spectra of NCNHP-1-Ts suggest the existence of Co, C, N and O (Fig. S9†). The high-resolution Co 2p spectra exhibit two dominating peaks with binding energies of ∼779 and ∼795 eV (Fig. 2a and S10†), corresponding to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. The Co 2p spectra can be deconvoluted into three characteristic peaks of Co0 (∼779 ± 0.2 eV), Co3+ (∼780.3 ± 0.1 eV), Co2+ (∼782 ± 0.1 eV).59 The C 1s spectra (Fig. 2b and S11†) can be fitted into three peaks, namely C–C at ∼284.6 eV, CN at ∼285.6 eV, and O–CO at ∼288.7 eV.60 The existence of CN further confirms the formation of nitrogen-doped carbon and is advantageous to provide more active sites and O2 adsorption sites.61 The adjacent C atoms can also reduce energy barriers for OER and ORR as a result of N-doping-induced charge re-distribution.62 Furthermore,",

The relative contents of pyridinic N and pyrrolic N decline slightly from NCNHP-1-400 to NCNHP-1-700 but that of graphitic N increases (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, NCNHP-1-500 possesses the highest relative contents of Co–Nx active moieties which are reported to be able to modify the local electronic atmosphere and promote the adsorption of intermediates,34 suggesting excellent bifunctional OER and ORR activities of NCNHP-1-500.\\nFor further comparison, the pyrolysis of sole ZIF-67 at 500 °C under H2/Ar was also conducted. As can be seen from the SEM and TEM images (Fig. S13†), no apparent CNTs were found on the surface, indicating that the addition of KCl can effectively accelerate the growth of CNTs. Furthermore, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal gravity (DTG) show that the presence of KCl is able to decrease the carbonization temperature of ZIF-67 (Fig. S14†). We speculate that KCl could interact with ZIF-67 during the pyrolysis process. ZIF-67 undergoes complete pyrolysis at 500 °C with the assistance of KCl, and the first formed metallic Co nanoparticles have an appropriate size to catalyze the growth of CNTs. When the pyrolysis temperature is close to the melting point of KCl (770 °C), the interaction force of KCl becomes stronger, which would reduce the stabilization of metallic Co nanoparticles and further induce more severe aggregation of Co nanoparticles and corrosion of the structure.63 The faster consumption of carbon at high temperatures also hinders the in situ growth of CNTs. In addition, Co/NPC-1-500-Ar prepared from the KCl/ZIF-67 mixture (1:1) under an Ar atmosphere at 500 °C did not form CNTs (Fig. S15†), suggesting the necessity of H2 to produce the CNT structure.\\nThe effect of KCl/ZIF-67 ratio on the morphology during pyrolysis was also investigated at 500 °C and the as-synthesized samples are named as NCNHP-r-500. From the SEM and TEM images (Fig. S16†), it is found that NCNHP-0.5-500 basically retains the original morphology of ZIF-67 and forms a hollow void with the formation of incomplete CNTs. However, the morphology of NCNHP is destroyed seriously when the ratio of KCl/ZIF-67 is higher than 2. When the ratio decreases to 5, part of the NCNHP-5-500 turns into broken pieces and lots of CNTs are observed on the surface. A further increase of the ratio to 10 leads to fully broken pieces on NCNHP-10-500. Most CNTs are unapparent and short which may be caused by the severe aggregation of cobalt nanoparticles and quick consumption of carbon. We assume that a large amount of KCl helps to disperse and wrap ZIF-67 more efficiently, and consequently generate a stronger interaction with ZIF-67 during the pyrolysis process, leading to the final broken structures of the derived carbon materials. In short, an appropriate KCl/ZIF-67 ratio has a critical impact on the formation of CNT assembled hollow polyhedra.\\nOER/ORR catalytic results\\nSubsequently, Tafel curves were obtained to get insight into the OER kinetics of the catalysts (Fig. 3b).

  "4": " a critical impact on the formation of CNT assembled hollow polyhedra.\\nOER/ORR catalytic results\\nSubsequently, Tafel curves were obtained to get insight into the OER kinetics of the catalysts (Fig. 3b). All the NCNHP-1-Ts prepared at different pyrolysis temperatures show similar Tafel slopes around 70 mV dec−1. The Tafel slope of NCNHP-1-500 is 70.1 mV dec−1, which is much lower than that of IrO2 (118.2 mV dec−1) and Pt/C (147.4 mV dec−1) (Fig. S17b†). The low Tafel slope suggests a favorable OER kinetics of NCNHP-1-500, which benefits from the unique hierarchical CNT structure with enhanced mass and electron transfer capacity. Interestingly, the Co/NPC-500 prepared without KCl displays a worse OER performance with an overpotential of 340 mV and a Tafel slope of 118.8 mV dec−1. Furthermore, the LSV curves and Tafel curves of NCNHP-r-500s prepared with various KCl/ZIF-67 ratios were also obtained (Fig. S18†). NCNHP-1-500 shows the best OER performance with the lowest overpotential and smallest Tafel slope. It is worth noting that the appropriate pyrolysis temperature and KCl/ZIF-67 ratio certainly promote the OER activity of derived materials, mainly owing to the outstanding hierarchical structure for charge transfer and the positive synergistic effect between N-doped CNTs and small Co nanoparticles.\\nThe electrochemical double-layer capacitances (Cdl), proportional to the electrochemically active surface (ECSA), were determined by using CV measurements in the non-faradaic region from 1.03 V to 1.14 V at different scan rates (Fig. S19†). As shown in Fig. 3c, the Cdl of NCNHP-1-500 (30.73 mF cm−2) is extraordinarily higher than those of other samples, which suggests that NCNHP-1-500 has the largest ECSA, indicating the prominent electrochemical activity for OER. Moreover, we conducted the chronoamperometry and long-term cycling tests of the optimal NCNHP-1-500 to estimate the catalytic stability. As exhibited in Fig. 3d, about 91% of the initial current density is retained after continuous operation for 10000 s, and the LSV curves obtained from the 1st and 1000th CV sweeps reveal only 8 mV negative shift, demonstrating the excellent durability of NCNHP-1-500. In addition, the SEM and TEM images of NCNHP-1-500 after 1000th CV sweeps show that the CNT structures are still retained and no obvious changes are found, further indicating the good stability of NCNHP-1-500 for OER (Fig. S20†).\\nIn addition to the excellent OER performances, NCNHPs also exhibit favorable ORR performances. The electrocatalytic activities of all the as-obtained samples were firstly evaluated by CV measurements in N2- and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. All the materials show featureless CV curves in N2-saturated solution but stronger cathodic peaks at 0.8–0.9 V in O2-saturated solution (Fig. S21†). Vividly, the peak position of NCNHP-1-500 (0.85 V) is more positive than those of other NCNHP-1-Ts, implying that NCNHP-1-500 may exhibit superior ORR activity. LSV curves were further collected in rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements at 1600 rpm. As displayed in Fig. 4a, NCNHP-1-500 shows the best ORR activity among all NCNHP-1-Ts, with the most positive onset potential of ∼0.910 V and half-wave potential (E1/2) of ∼0.828 V, primarily benefitting from its good-morphology CNT architecture and abundant Co–Nx active sites. Conversely, Co/NPC-500 without CNT structures shows an unsatisfactory ORR performance with a lower half-wave potential of ∼0.793 V, suggesting that the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of NCNHP-1-500 may be attributed to the synergistic effect between the active sites and CNTs. Importantly, the E1/2 of NCNHP-1-500 is almost comparable to that of Pt/C (0.834 V) and far",

Importantly, the E1/2 of NCNHP-1-500 is almost comparable to that of Pt/C (0.834 V) and far superior to that of commercial IrO2 (0.707 V) (Fig. S22a†). Additionally, NCNHP-1-500 has the highest diffusion-limited current density (JL) (5.44 mA cm−2) among these catalysts, even better than that of commercial Pt/C (5.20 mA cm−2) (Fig. 4b). LSV measurements were also applied to determine the ORR performances of catalysts prepared by using different KCl/ZIF-67 ratios (Fig. S22b†). Notably, the E1/2 decreases as the KCl/ZIF-67 ratio increases, which might be related to the deterioration of derived morphology and severe aggregation of Co nanoparticles.\\nThe chemical stability of NCNHP-1-500 was further evaluated through long-term chronoamperometric experiments at 0.7 V. As shown in Fig. 4c, NCNHP-1-500 exhibits excellent long-term stability with 90% current retention after 20000 s, whereas the current retention of Pt/C decreases to 77% after 10000 s. Additionally, the SEM and TEM images of NCNHP-1-500 after the stability test for ORR also show the morphology-retained CNT structure, suggesting that NCNHP-1-500 is a stable catalyst for ORR (Fig. S23†). NCNHP-1-500 also shows superior methanol tolerance to commercial Pt/C. There is no significant change in current density for NCNHP-1-500 after the addition of 10 mL methanol into the electrolyte at 1600 rpm. However, a big decay was observed on Pt/C. These results indicate that NCNHP-1-500 is a potential catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells. Subsequently, to explore the ORR reaction pathway of NCNHP-1-500, rotating risk-desk electrode (RRDE) measurements were applied to estimate the yield of the peroxide (HO2−) intermediate and the corresponding electron-transfer numbers (n). As shown in Fig. 4d, the as-synthesized NCNHP-1-500 exhibits a low HO2− yield less than 8% in the potential range from 0.2 to 0.8 V and a high n-value of ∼3.85 that is close to the calculated n-value of Pt/C (3.87–3.95). Therefore, NCNHP-1-500 should undergo a dominated four-electron (4e−) pathway in the ORR reaction.\\nThe present results suggest that NCNHP-1-500 could be one of the prospective candidates for OER/ORR bifunctional electrocatalysts. The potential difference (ΔE) between the OER potentials at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Ej=10) and the ORR half-wave potential (E1/2), defined as ΔE = Ej=10 − E1/2, is a crucial bifunctional performance parameter and has been used here to assess the overall oxygen electrode activity. From Table S2,† it is found that NCNHP-1-500 affords the lowest ΔE of 0.712 V among the NCNHP-1-Ts, implying the superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of NCNHP-1-500. In fact, our NCNHP-1-500 also surpasses most of the recently reported Co-based bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysts (Table S3†).', 'Conclusions': '', 'Conflicts of interest': '', 'Acknowledgements': \"B.
