    "Buckminsterfullerene (C60) was adsorbed onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as an electronacceptor to induce intermolecular charge-transfer with the SWCNTs, leading to a class of new metal-free C60 -SWCNT electrocatalysts. For the ﬁrst time, these newly developed C60 SWCNTs were demonstrated to act as trifunctional metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a wide range of pH values, from acid to alkaline, with even higher electrocatalytic activities and better longterm stabilities than those of commercial Pt and RuO2  counterparts. Thus, the adsorption-induced intermolecular charge-transfer with the C 60 electron-acceptor can provide a general approach to high-performance, metal-free, pH-universal carbon-based trifunctional metal-free electrocatalysts for water-splitting and beyond.\n",

    "Since the discovery of the ﬁrst C-MFEC in 2009, 8 enormous progress has been made and various carbon nanomaterials including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and carbon quantum dots, doped with heteroatoms (e.g., N, B, S) have been developed for the ORR, OER, and/or HER electrocatalysis. 2,7,9 Besides, various heteroatom-doped carbon composites, such as graphene quantum dots/graphene nanoribbons and graphene/CNT structures, have also been reported for metal-free electrolysis. 10 For ORR, combined experimental and theoretical studies have revealed that the improved catalytic performance of heteroatom-doped carbons could be attributed to the electron-accepting/donating abilities of the heteroatom(s) to create net positive/negative charge(s) on adjacent carbon atoms to change the chemisorption mode of O 2 onto the C-MFECs, which eﬀectively weakens the O−O bonding and facilitates the ORR process.8,11 \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the intramolecular charge-transfer that imparts ORR electrocatalytic activities to heteroatom-doped carbon nanotubes, graphene, and graphite described above, pure carbon CNTs or graphene, either in an aligned or nonaligned form, adsorbed with certain polyelectrolytes (e.g., PDDA) have also been demonstrated to act as metal-free electrocatalysts for ORR through the intermolecular chargetransfer from the all-carbon CNTs or graphene to the adsorbed PDDA 12a,b or PEDOT. 12c In particular, we demonstrated that the PDDA-adsorbed vertically aligned CNT electrode possesses remarkable electrocatalytic properties for ORR,12b  similar to those of a commercially available Pt/C electrode. These results clearly indicate that the important role of intermolecular charge-transfer to ORR can be applied to carbon nanomaterials in general for the development of various other metal-free eﬃcient ORR catalysts for fuel cell applications, even new catalytic materials for applications beyond fuel cells (e.g., metal−air batteries, electrochemical biosensors). These previous studies prompted us to leverage the strong charge-transfer eﬀects between uncharged C 60 and CNTs for producing stable and eﬃcient multifunctional electrocatalysts largely free from heteroatom-doping and defect, a promising possibility that has not been recognized so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Owing to its unique spherical molecular structure, with all sp2 -hybridized carbon atoms, and unparalleled electron aﬃnity, capable of accepting six electrons per C 60 molecule, buckminsterfullerene (C60 ) has been widely studied for biomedical and optoelectronic applications. 13 As such, various C60 -CNT composites, including C60 -encapsulated CNT peapod structures 14 and C60 -grafted CNTs, 15 have been developed for electrochemical sensing and many other applications. However, the possible application of C 60 for electrocatalysis has rarely been discussed in the literature. To our best knowledge, no C60 -based multifunctional electrocatalyst has been reported to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we adsorbed C 60 onto single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to cause intermolecular charge-transfer with SWCNTs, leading to even better electrocatalytic activities than those of commercial Pt and RuO 2 catalysts for ORR, OER, and HER. We further demonstrated that the resultant high-performance C60 -SWCNT multifunctional electrocatalysts are promising for water-splitting 16 and beyond. 17 As schematically shown in Figure 1a, the newly developed C60 SWCNTs can act as both eﬃcient metal-free ORR/OER/HER trifunctional and OER/HER bifunctional catalysts (vide infra). Therefore, this work has not only opened up new applications for C 60 but also provided a facile, but eﬃcient and cost-eﬀective, approach to metal-free, heteroatom-/defect-free multifunctional ORR/OER/HER catalysts simply by adsorbing C 60 onto SWCNTs.\n",

    "In a typical experiment, the adsorption of C 60 onto SWCNTs was carried out by simply dispersing SWCNTs in an aqueous solution of C 60 for different durations (denoted as C60-SWCNTn , n = 5, 10, 15, and 20 min; see Experimental Section). The content of C 60 in C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15, and 20 min) was monitored by UV−vis absorption measurements. As shown in Figure 1b, the intensities of the characteristic absorption bands of the C 60 solution at 277 and 360 nm, 19 respectively, decreased with increasing n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min), indicating that an increased number of C60  molecules were adsorbed onto the SWCNT in C60 -SWCNTn  samples with increasing adsorption time (Figure 1c). Over adsorption for 15 min, however, the C 60 adsorption bands remained unchanged (e.g., C60 -SWCNT15 , C60 -SWCNT 20 in Figure 1b,c), suggesting that the adsorption of C 60 onto the surface of SWCNTs was saturated after 15 min adsorption in this particular case, and hence the similar amount of adsorbed C 60 for both the C60 -SWCNT 15 and C60 -SWCNT20 . Figures S1 and S3 show transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for pure C60 , SWCNTs, and the resultant C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min), which revealed a diameter of 1.2 nm for the SWCNT (Figure S1a), as also supported by the radial breathing modes (RBMs) of SWCNTs at 217.3 cm−1 , corresponding to a nanotube diameter of 1.14 nm (Figure S2).20 Figure S1b reproduces a typical TEM image for pure C60  nanoparticles with a diameter of about 1.3 nm, revealing particle features similar to those of the C 60 nanoparticles in the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) shown in Figure S3. Other evidence for physical adsorption of C 60 on SWCNTs comes from FTIR spectra (Figure S4), which show that the FT-IR spectrum of C60 -SWCNTs is a simple combination of those for C 60 and SWCNTs without any peak position shift, indicating no strong chemical interaction between C 60 and SWCNTs. The XRD patterns in Figure S5 show that the C60 , SWCNTs, and C60 -SWCNT 15 all have a high degree of crystallization, implying a good charge mobility and electrochemical stability for C60 -SWCNT 15 free from heteroatom and defect (Figure 1d−f).20 \n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Figure 1d) clearly veriﬁed the absence of any metal elements for SWCNTs produced by the metal-free growth, 9d but the presence of O and Si apart from C. The O and Si with an atomic ratio of O to Si of 2.11 are from the SiO 2 substrate used for the SWCNTs XPS measurements. XPS and Raman measurements were also performed to conﬁrm the adsorption of C 60 onto SWCNTs as well as the associated intermolecular charge-transfer. Compared to the C 1s XPS peak for pure C60 , the C 1s XPS peak positions for C60 -SWCNT n (n = 0, 5, 10, and 15 min) show a negative shift to lower binding energies with increasing adsorption time n (Figure 1e), indicating the occurrence of charge-transfer from the SWCNTs to C60 . 9d The observed intermolecular charge-transfer was also supported by Raman spectroscopic measurements carried out for the pure SWCNTs before and after adsorption with C60 . As expected, the Raman spectrum of SWCNTs displays two prominent peaks at ∼1611 and ∼1344 cm −1 corresponding to the G- and D-bands, respectively, while Raman spectrum of C 60 shows only one peak at ∼1643 cm−1 . Raman spectra of C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) exhibit a slight increase in the intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band with increasing C60  adsorption time (Figure 1f), also accompanied by an upshift of the peak positions. While the upshift in the peak position supports the charge-transfer from SWCNTs to the electronwithdrawing C60 , the increase in the peak intensity ratio of the D-band to G-band (ID /IG ) for C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) indicates that the nanotube structure became slightly more disordered via the adsorption-induced charge-transfer to C60 .\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate electrocatalytic properties, we initially performed the ORR measurements on C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) in 0.1 M KOH. For comparison, pure C60 , pure SWCNTs, and Pt/C (20 wt%, Johnson Matthey) were also measured under the same conditions. Compared with the pure C 60 (onset potential, E onset = 0.62 V, half-wave potential, E 1/2 = 0.53 V, and diﬀusion-limiting current, I dl = 0.24 mA/ cm2 ) and SWCNTs (E onset = 0.84 V, E 1/2 = 0.80 V, and I dl = 0.32 mA/cm2 ), all the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) catalysts showed better ORR performance (Figure S6 and Table S1). These results conﬁrm that charge-transfer between the adsorbed C 60 and SWCNTs have indeed contributed to the ORR electrocatalytic activity for the C60 -SWCNTs. Among all the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) samples, the highest ORR activity was observed for C60 -SWCNT 15 in terms of Eonset  (0.91 V), E 1/2 (0.84 V), and I dl (1.73 mA/cm2 , Figure S6), presumably due to the lowest charge-transfer resistance (Figure S7) at this mass ratio. Therefore, we focus mainly on the C60 -SWCNT 15 below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, we carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of C60 -SWCNT 15 in a conventional threeelectrode electrochemical cell in an O2 - or N2 -saturated 0.1 M aqueous KOH solution. As shown in Figures 2a and S8, a characteristic oxygen reduction peak at 0.86, 0.79, and 0.48 V (versus RHE) was observed for the C60 -SWCNT15 , pure SWCNTs, and C60 , respectively, in O2 -saturated 0.1 M aqueous KOH, but not in the N2 -saturated electrolyte, indicating a high ORR activity for the C60 -SWCNT15 . Furthermore, the C60 -SWCNT 15 electrode exhibited an excellent stability for the ORR with respect to Pt/C. Figure 2c shows only 7.4% current reduction for the C60 -SWCNT15  catalyst after a 50 h chronoamperometric test at 0.7 V with O2  continuously ﬂowing into 0.1 M KOH. However, the Pt/C catalyst lost 9.9% of its initial activity under the same conditions, indicating a higher ORR stability for the C60 SWCNTs than that of the commercial Pt/C (Figure 2c).\n",
    "\n",
    "To further investigate impacts of the charge-transfer between C 60 and SWCNTs and to demonstrate the potential applications of C60 -SWCNTs as trifunctional catalysts for ORR, OER, and HER, we also measured the OER performance for C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) samples in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. As shown in Figures 2d and S9, C60 SWCNT 15 exhibited the highest catalytic activity for the OER (Table S2). At 1.69 V potential, the current density of C60 SWCNT 15 (10 mA cm−2 ) is 50, 5.3, and 1.2 times higher than those of the pure C60 , SWCNTs, and commercial RuO2 , respectively (Figure 2d). These observations clearly demonstrated that the charge-transfer from C 60 to SWCNT has also signiﬁcantly enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of C60 SWCNTs for OER. Moreover, the C 60 -SWCNT 15 electrocatalyst produced a much lower Tafel slope (46.7 mV dec−1 ) compared with those of the pure C −1 60 (50.5 mV dec−1 ) and SWCNTs electrodes (79.7 mV dec ), though still slightly higher than that of RuO 2 (38.1 mV dec−1 ), indicating more favorable kinetics toward OER by the C60 -SWCNT 15 electrode (Figure 2e). The steady-state current densities of the C60 SWCNT 15 show only 7.9% current reduction for 10 h at 1.65 V in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (Figure 2f), while they remain unchanged at the initial state (inset of Figure 2f). In contrast, 15.1% of the initial activity of RuO 2 was lost (Figure 2f) under the same conditions. Remarkably, the C60 -SWCNT 15 exhibited a ΔE of 0.82 V (Figure S10), which is much lower than that of some other carbon-based metal-free materials (e.g., Ngraphene/CNT, ΔE = 1.00 V; 21 g-C3 N4 -carbon-ﬁber paper, ΔE = 1.06 V22 ).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, HER activities of the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10,and 15 min) were also investigated in N2 -saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte using a three-electrode setup. For comparison, we have recorded the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for the pure C60 , SWCNTs, and Pt/C. As shown in Figures 2g and S11, all the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) catalysts exhibited enhanced catalytic activity compared with the pure C 60 and SWCNTs. In particular, C60 -SWCNT15  showed an onset overpotential of ∼114 mV (Table S3). The corresponding Tafel plots (Figure 2h) show a lower Tafel slope (120.8 mV dec −1 ) for C60 -SWCNT 15 than those of C60  (202.7 mV dec −1 ) and SWCNTs (139.2 mV dec −1 ), suggesting that the release of molecular hydrogen on the C60 -SWCNT 15 is the rate-limiting step.17 \n",
    "\n",
    "The overpotential required to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm −2 (Figure 2g) for the C60 -SWCNT 15 and Pt/C are −0.38 and −0.14 V, respectively. Figure 2i displays the polarization curves for the C60 -SWCNT 15 electrode before and after the continuous HER process (15 h), showing only a slight decrease (7.1%) in performanceeven more stable than the Pt/C electrode (10.7%). Overall, the C60 -SWCNT 15 catalyst exhibited a low onset potential, high current density, and longterm stability, also promising for HER in the alkaline medium. These results indicate that the C60 -SWCNT 15 is a promising eﬃcient trifunctional catalyst for simultaneous water-splitting and ORR.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from the above discussion, the C60 -SWCNT catalysts newly developed in this study have been demonstrated to show excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media. However, pH values for catalysts to show the best performance for ORR, OER, or HER are usually diﬀerent. 7e Unlike most HER electrocatalysts, ORR and OER electrocatalysts often show better performance in an alkaline medium than acidic electrolyte. 7e,10d This makes it very diﬃcult, if not possible, to develop integrated energy systems for practical applications, for instance, when HER is coupled with OER in an overall water-splitting process. Therefore, it is important to develop low-cost, pH-universal trifunctional electrocatalysts for eﬀectively catalyzing ORR, OER, and HER simultaneously at any speciﬁc pH values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to alkaline and acidic electrolytes, the benign and harmless pH-neutral medium could simplify the situation for optimization of the ORR, HER, and OER trifunctional electrocatalysts. It is thus highly desirable, though still challenging, to develop eﬃcient trifunctional C-MFECs to achieve high catalytic activities toward OER and HER for overall water-splitting 23 and ORR for microbial fuel cells24  under neutral conditions. In this regard, we further tested the electrocatalytic performance of C60 -SWCNT 15 for ORR, OER, and HER with a typical three-electrode system in a phosphate buﬀer solution (pH = 7). As shown in Figures 3a and S12, characteristic oxygen reduction peaks at 0.71, 0.63, and 0.60 V (versus RHE) were observed for the C60 -SWCNT15 , pure SWCNTs, and C60 , respectively, in the O2 -saturated phosphate buﬀer solution, but not in the corresponding N2 -saturated electrolyte under the same condition. As expected, the C60 SWCNT 15 exhibited also the highest ORR activity in the neutral phosphate buﬀer solution. This is also conﬁrmed by the LSV curves shown in Figures 3b and S13, which reveal E onset = 0.81 V, E 1/2 = 0.77 V, and I dl = 1.31 mA/cm 2 for the C60 SWCNT15 , outperforming the C60 , SWCNTs and other C60 SWCNT n (n = 5 and 10 min), though still slightly inferior to the Pt/C electrode. Furthermore, Figure 3c shows results from the chronoamperometric test under 0.6 V with continuous O2  ﬂow in the phosphate buﬀer solution for the C60 -SWCNT electrode, revealing only a 6.3% reduction in current from the initial state after a 20 h, which is lower than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (a 9.9% loss) under the same condition. As shown in the inset of Figure 3c, the corresponding LSV curves for the C60 -SWCNTs remained almost unchanged, indicating that the C60 -SWCNTs is also slightly more stable than the commercial Pt/C electrode toward ORR at the neutral pH.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also tested the OER and HER performance of the C60 SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) catalysts in the phosphate buﬀer solution. For comparison, pure C60 , pure SWCNTs, Pt/ C (20 wt%, Johnson Matthey), and RuO 2 were also measured under the same conditions. Figures 3d and S14 show 970, 720, 770, 620, and 480 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for the pure C60 , pure SWCNTs, C60 -SWCNT5 , C60 -SWCNT10 , and commercial RuO2 , respectively (see also Table S5). In contrast, the C60 SWCNT 15 electrocatalyst exhibited a relatively low overpotential of 520 mV at 10 mA cm −2 with a low onset overpotential of 230 mV (Figure 3d). Notably, the current density of C 60 -SWCNT at an overpotential of 600 mV is 20.0 mA cm−2 , which is 14.115 and 3.5 times higher than those of the pure C 60 (1.4 mA cm−2 ) and SWCNTs (5.8 mA cm−2 ), respectively, and even superior to the commercial RuO 2 (15.5 mA cm −2 ). The C 60 -SWCNT showed a Tafel slope of 129 mV dec −1 (Figure 3e), which15 is comparable to that of the commercial RuO (141.1 mV dec −1 ), but much lower than those of the pure 2 C 60 (848.2 mV dec −1 ) and SWCNTs (848.2 and 468.1 mV dec −1 ). As expected, Figure S15 shows the smallest charge-transfer resistance for C60 -SWCNT 15 among the pure C60 , SWCNTs, C60 -SWCNT5 , and C60 -SWCNT10 . As can be seen in Figure 3f, the catalytic activity of C60 -SWCNT15,  along with the LSV curves (inset of Figure 3f), remained almost unchanged for more than 7.5 h. These results suggest that C60 -SWCNT 15 also exhibited an unprecedentedly remarkable catalytic activity and stability toward the OER in the neutral medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figures 3g and S16 show the HER LSV curves for all the samples investigated in this study in the neutral phosphate buﬀer solution. As expected, the pure C 60 has negligible electrocatalytic activity toward HER, and Pt/C showed the best performance with nearly zero overpotential. C60 SWCNT 15 exhibited a sharply rising current density with increasing negative potential and a low onset overpotential of 60 mV, suggesting a high HER catalytic activity for the C60 SWCNT15 . For comparison, the C60 -SWCNT 15 exhibited an overpotentials of 329 mV at 10 mA cm−2 , while the corresponding overpotentials for the pure SWCNTs, C60 - SWCNT5 , and C60 -SWCNT 10 are 738, 420, and 327 mV, respectively (Table S6). Figure 3h shows the Tafel slopes for the Pt/C electrocatalyst (76.7 mV dec −1 ), C 60 -SWCNT 15 (166.1 mV dec−1 ), and pure SWCNTs (236.9 mV dec−1 ) in the neutral medium. The steady-state current density of the C60 -SWCNT 15 shows a small change (8.8%) even after 15 h (Figure 3i), even smaller than the corresponding value of 12% for the Pt/C catalyst, along with the almost unchanged LSV curves for the C60 -SWCNT 15 (inset of Figure 3i). Clearly, therefore, the C60 -SWCNT 15 is also a good metal-free HER catalyst in the neutral medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OER performance of C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) catalysts was also measured in 0.5 M H2 SO4 , for comparison with pure C60 , SWCNTs, and commercial RuO 2 catalyst (Table S7). Figures 4a and S17 show an onset potential of ∼1.26 V for the C60 -SWCNT15 , which represents an overpotential of ∼420 mV and is even lower than that of RuO2  catalyst (∼1.28 V, overpotential ∼430 mV). The Tafel slope shown in Figure 4b for the C60 2 -SWCNT 15 is 38.4 mV dec −1 , which is similar to that of RuO catalyst (37.4 mV dec −1 ). The steady-state current density of the C60 -SWCNT 15 showed a small change (5.0%) even after 1.5 h in 0.5 M H2 SO 4 (Figure 4c), similar to the corresponding value of 5.4% for the commercial RuO 2 catalyst, along with the almost unchanged LSV curves for the C60 -SWCNT 15 (inset of Figure 4c). These results indicate a good stability for C60 -SWCNT 15 toward OER, even in the acidic medium. The electrocatalytic performance of the C60 -SWCNT electrode for HER were also measured with a three-electrode conﬁguration in 0.5 M H2 SO4 . As can be seen in Figures 4d and S18, the pure C60  showed almost no catalytic activity, while SWCNT electrode exhibited much better catalytic performance with an onset potential of ∼145 mV and overpotential of 1015 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for HER in the acidic medium. Surprisingly, the C60 SWCNT n (n = 0, 5, 10, and 15 min) electrodes showed much improved electrocatalytic performance, in respect to both pure C 60 and SWCNTs, with a relatively low onset potential of ∼108 and 320 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 current (Figure 4d, Table S8). As displayed in Figure 4e, the Tafel slope of C 60 -SWCNT 15 for HER is 73.2 mV dec −1 , which is the smallest among those for the pure C 60 (568 mV dec −1 ) and SWCNTs electrocatalysts (118.2 mV dec −1 ). The observed low Tafel slope indicates a fast HER process for C60 SWCNT15 . The fast OER and HER reaction kinetics of C60 SWCNT 15 is also reﬂected by the smallest charge-transfer resistance for C60 -SWCNT 15 among the pure C60 , SWCNTs, and C60 -SWCNT n (n = 0, 5, 10, and 15 min) (Figure S19). The steady-state current density of the C60 -SWCNT 15 showed a small change (2.9%) after 20 h (Figure 4f), even smaller than the corresponding value of 4.4% for the commercial Pt/C catalyst, along with the almost unchanged LSV curves for the C60 -SWCNT 15 before and after the chronoamperometric test (inset of Figure 4f). Thus, the C60 -SWCNT 15 also showed a superior stability to the Pt/C toward HER in acidic medium. Table 1 summarizes electrocatalytic properties for the C60 SWCNT 15 at various pHs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate potential applications for the C60 SWCNT15 , we investigated a two-electrode electrochemical water-splitting setup, in which the C60 -SWCNT 15 was used as both anode and cathode for OER and HER, respectively, in several diﬀerent electrolyte solutions (e.g., 0.1 M KOH, phosphate buﬀer solution, and 0.5 M H2 SO4 ). As seen in Figure S21a, the C60 -SWCNT 15 HER electrode (with the same C60 -SWCNT 15 as the OER counter electrode) showed a small onset potential of −210 mV and a gradually increased current density with increasing potential. In conjunction with the other half of the water-splitting OER reaction (Figure S21b), the galvanostatic cycling method demonstrated an attractive two electrode water-splitting process for the setup based on the C60 -SWCNT 15 bifunctional catalysts, which is comparable to its counterpart based on the Pt/C for ORR and RuO 2 for OER. Similar to the control setup, Figure S21c shows a good operation stability for the electrochemical water-splitting setup, in which the C60 -SWCNT 15 was used as both the anode and cathode for OER and HER, respectively. H 2 bubbles generated from the C60 -SWCNT 15 electrode during the water-splitting process could easily leave from the electrode surface (inset Figure S21c) to ensure a long-term stability. C60 -SWCNT15  was also found to show superior water-splitting performance in acidic and neutral media (see Figures S22 and S23).\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain a better mechanistic understanding of the observed electrocatalytic activities for C60 -SWCNT 15 catalysts, we performed energy level diagram analyses (Figure S24). As can be seen in Figure S24, the LUMO level of C 60 (−4.46 eV) matches well with the energy level for the HER and ORR while the HOMO level of the SWCNTs (−6.38 eV) is favorable for the OER. The bandgaps of the SWCNTs (6.38 to 4.34 eV)25  and C 60 (6.30 to 4.46 eV) 26 are in the visible region. Therefore, the formation of the C60 -SWCNTs junction enabled the observed metal-free electrocatalysis for HER, ORR, and OER as well as the use of visible light to aﬀect the electrocatalytic performance of C60 -SWCNTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the possible light eﬀects, we used 404.7579.0 nm visible light (mercury lamp, 1.0 W cm−2 ) to excite the C60 -SWCNT15 . Indeed, it was found that exposure of C60 SWCNT 15 to visible light enhanced electrocatalytic activities for ORR/HER/OER in O2 -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution and in phosphate buﬀer solution (Figures S25 and S26). However, the ORR/HER/OER performance of pure C 60 and SWCNTs remained unchanged even when they were exposed to the same visible light under the same conditions (Figures S27S29). Furthermore, the photoinduced current enhancements for the C60 -SWCNT 15 were found to be highly reversible and reproducible (Figures S30−S32), showing great potential for practical photoelectrocatalysis. The above observed photoenhanced electrocatalytic currents are not inconsistent with the photoinduced reduction in the charge-transfer resistance of C60 -SWCNT15 , as shown in Figure S33, both of which are, most probably, arising from the light-induced charge-transfer between the intimately contacted C 60 and SWCNTs (cf. Figure S24).\n",

As shown in Figure 1b, the intensities of the characteristic absorption bands of the C 60 solution at 277 and 360 nm, 19 respectively, decreased with increasing n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min), indicating that an increased number of C60  molecules were adsorbed onto the SWCNT in C60 -SWCNTn  samples with increasing adsorption time (Figure 1c). Over adsorption for 15 min, however, the C 60 adsorption bands remained unchanged (e.g., C60 -SWCNT15 , C60 -SWCNT 20 in Figure 1b,c), suggesting that the adsorption of C 60 onto the surface of SWCNTs was saturated after 15 min adsorption in this particular case, and hence the similar amount of adsorbed C 60 for both the C60 -SWCNT 15 and C60 -SWCNT20 . Figures S1 and S3 show transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for pure C60 , SWCNTs, and the resultant C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min), which revealed a diameter of 1.2 nm for the SWCNT (Figure S1a), as also supported by the radial breathing modes (RBMs) of SWCNTs at 217.3 cm−1 , corresponding to a nanotube diameter of 1.14 nm (Figure S2).20 Figure S1b reproduces a typical TEM image for pure C60  nanoparticles with a diameter of about 1.3 nm, revealing particle features similar to those of the C 60 nanoparticles in the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) shown in Figure S3. Other evidence for physical adsorption of C 60 on SWCNTs comes from FTIR spectra (Figure S4), which show that the FT-IR spectrum of C60 -SWCNTs is a simple combination of those for C 60 and SWCNTs without any peak position shift, indicating no strong chemical interaction between C 60 and SWCNTs. The XRD patterns in Figure S5 show that the C60 , SWCNTs, and C60 -SWCNT 15 all have a high degree of crystallization, implying a good charge mobility and electrochemical stability for C60 -SWCNT 15 free from heteroatom and defect (Figure 1d−f).20 ',\n",
       " 1: 'The corresponding X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Figure 1d) clearly veriﬁed the absence of any metal elements for SWCNTs produced by the metal-free growth, 9d but the presence of O and Si apart from C. The O and Si with an atomic ratio of O to Si of 2.11 are from the SiO 2 substrate used for the SWCNTs XPS measurements. XPS and Raman measurements were also performed to conﬁrm the adsorption of C 60 onto SWCNTs as well as the associated intermolecular charge-transfer. Compared to the C 1s XPS peak for pure C60 , the C 1s XPS peak positions for C60 -SWCNT n (n = 0, 5, 10, and 15 min) show a negative shift to lower binding energies with increasing adsorption time n (Figure 1e), indicating the occurrence of charge-transfer from the SWCNTs to C60 . 9d The observed intermolecular charge-transfer was also supported by Raman spectroscopic measurements carried out for the pure SWCNTs before and after adsorption with C60 . As expected, the Raman spectrum of SWCNTs displays two prominent peaks at ∼1611 and ∼1344 cm −1 corresponding to the G- and D-bands, respectively, while Raman spectrum of C 60 shows only one peak at ∼1643 cm−1 . Raman spectra of C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) exhibit a slight increase in the intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band with increasing C60  adsorption time (Figure 1f), also accompanied by an upshift of the peak positions. While the upshift in the peak position supports the charge-transfer from SWCNTs to the electronwithdrawing C60 , the increase in the peak intensity ratio of the D-band to G-band (ID /IG ) for C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) indicates that the nanotube structure became slightly more disordered via the adsorption-induced charge-transfer to C60 .',\n",
       " 2: 'To investigate electrocatalytic properties, we initially performed the ORR measurements on C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) in 0.1 M KOH. For comparison, pure C60 , pure SWCNTs, and Pt/C (20 wt%, Johnson Matthey) were also measured under the same conditions. Compared with the pure C 60 (onset potential, E onset = 0.62 V, half-wave potential, E 1/2 = 0.53 V, and diﬀusion-limiting current, I dl = 0.24 mA/ cm2 ) and SWCNTs (E onset = 0.84 V, E 1/2 = 0.80 V, and I dl = 0.32 mA/cm2 ), all the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) catalysts showed better ORR performance (Figure S6 and Table S1). These results conﬁrm that charge-transfer between the adsorbed C 60 and SWCNTs have indeed contributed to the ORR electrocatalytic activity for the C60 -SWCNTs. Among all the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) samples, the highest ORR activity was observed for C60 -SWCNT 15 in terms of Eonset  (0.91 V), E 1/2 (0.84 V), and I dl (1.73 mA/cm2 , Figure S6), presumably due to the lowest charge-transfer resistance (Figure S7) at this mass ratio. Therefore, we focus mainly on the C60 -SWCNT 15 below.',\n",
       " 3: 'To start with, we carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of C60 -SWCNT 15 in a conventional threeelectrode electrochemical cell in an O2 - or N2 -saturated 0.1 M aqueous KOH solution. As shown in Figures 2a and S8, a characteristic oxygen reduction peak at 0.86, 0.79, and 0.48 V (versus RHE) was observed for the C60 -SWCNT15 , pure SWCNTs, and C60 , respectively, in O2 -saturated 0.1 M aqueous KOH, but not in the N2 -saturated electrolyte, indicating a high ORR activity for the C60 -SWCNT15 . Furthermore, the C60 -SWCNT 15 electrode exhibited an excellent stability for the ORR with respect to Pt/C. Figure 2c shows only 7.4% current reduction for the C60 -SWCNT15  catalyst after a 50 h chronoamperometric test at 0.7 V with O2  continuously ﬂowing into 0.1 M KOH. However, the Pt/C catalyst lost 9.9% of its initial activity under the same conditions, indicating a higher ORR stability for the C60 SWCNTs than that of the commercial Pt/C (Figure 2c).',\n",
       " 4: 'To further investigate impacts of the charge-transfer between C 60 and SWCNTs and to demonstrate the potential applications of C60 -SWCNTs as trifunctional catalysts for ORR, OER, and HER, we also measured the OER performance for C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) samples in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. As shown in Figures 2d and S9, C60 SWCNT 15 exhibited the highest catalytic activity for the OER (Table S2). At 1.69 V potential, the current density of C60 SWCNT 15 (10 mA cm−2 ) is 50, 5.3, and 1.2 times higher than those of the pure C60 , SWCNTs, and commercial RuO2 , respectively (Figure 2d). These observations clearly demonstrated that the charge-transfer from C 60 to SWCNT has also signiﬁcantly enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of C60 SWCNTs for OER. Moreover, the C 60 -SWCNT 15 electrocatalyst produced a much lower Tafel slope (46.7 mV dec−1 ) compared with those of the pure C −1 60 (50.5 mV dec−1 ) and SWCNTs electrodes (79.7 mV dec ), though still slightly higher than that of RuO 2 (38.1 mV dec−1 ), indicating more favorable kinetics toward OER by the C60 -SWCNT 15 electrode (Figure 2e). The steady-state current densities of the C60 SWCNT 15 show only 7.9% current reduction for 10 h at 1.65 V in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte (Figure 2f), while they remain unchanged at the initial state (inset of Figure 2f). In contrast, 15.1% of the initial activity of RuO 2 was lost (Figure 2f) under the same conditions. Remarkably, the C60 -SWCNT 15 exhibited a ΔE of 0.82 V (Figure S10), which is much lower than that of some other carbon-based metal-free materials (e.g., Ngraphene/CNT, ΔE = 1.00 V; 21 g-C3 N4 -carbon-ﬁber paper, ΔE = 1.06 V22 ).',\n",
       " 5: 'In addition, HER activities of the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10,and 15 min) were also investigated in N2 -saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolyte using a three-electrode setup. For comparison, we have recorded the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves for the pure C60 , SWCNTs, and Pt/C. As shown in Figures 2g and S11, all the C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) catalysts exhibited enhanced catalytic activity compared with the pure C 60 and SWCNTs. In particular, C60 -SWCNT15  showed an onset overpotential of ∼114 mV (Table S3). The corresponding Tafel plots (Figure 2h) show a lower Tafel slope (120.8 mV dec −1 ) for C60 -SWCNT 15 than those of C60  (202.7 mV dec −1 ) and SWCNTs (139.2 mV dec −1 ), suggesting that the release of molecular hydrogen on the C60 -SWCNT 15 is the rate-limiting step.17 ',\n",
       " 6: 'The overpotential required to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm −2 (Figure 2g) for the C60 -SWCNT 15 and Pt/C are −0.38 and −0.14 V, respectively. Figure 2i displays the polarization curves for the C60 -SWCNT 15 electrode before and after the continuous HER process (15 h), showing only a slight decrease (7.1%) in performance\\ue0d5even more stable than the Pt/C electrode (10.7%). Overall, the C60 -SWCNT 15 catalyst exhibited a low onset potential, high current density, and longterm stability, also promising for HER in the alkaline medium. These results indicate that the C60 -SWCNT 15 is a promising eﬃcient trifunctional catalyst for simultaneous water-splitting and ORR.',\n",
       " 7: 'As can be seen from the above discussion, the C60 -SWCNT catalysts newly developed in this study have been demonstrated to show excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic performance in alkaline media. However, pH values for catalysts to show the best performance for ORR, OER, or HER are usually diﬀerent. 7e Unlike most HER electrocatalysts, ORR and OER electrocatalysts often show better performance in an alkaline medium than acidic electrolyte. 7e,10d This makes it very diﬃcult, if not possible, to develop integrated energy systems for practical applications, for instance, when HER is coupled with OER in an overall water-splitting process. Therefore, it is important to develop low-cost, pH-universal trifunctional electrocatalysts for eﬀectively catalyzing ORR, OER, and HER simultaneously at any speciﬁc pH values.',\n",
       " 8: 'Compared to alkaline and acidic electrolytes, the benign and harmless pH-neutral medium could simplify the situation for optimization of the ORR, HER, and OER trifunctional electrocatalysts. It is thus highly desirable, though still challenging, to develop eﬃcient trifunctional C-MFECs to achieve high catalytic activities toward OER and HER for overall water-splitting 23 and ORR for microbial fuel cells24  under neutral conditions. In this regard, we further tested the electrocatalytic performance of C60 -SWCNT 15 for ORR, OER, and HER with a typical three-electrode system in a phosphate buﬀer solution (pH = 7). As shown in Figures 3a and S12, characteristic oxygen reduction peaks at 0.71, 0.63, and 0.60 V (versus RHE) were observed for the C60 -SWCNT15 , pure SWCNTs, and C60 , respectively, in the O2 -saturated phosphate buﬀer solution, but not in the corresponding N2 -saturated electrolyte under the same condition. As expected, the C60 SWCNT 15 exhibited also the highest ORR activity in the neutral phosphate buﬀer solution. This is also conﬁrmed by the LSV curves shown in Figures 3b and S13, which reveal E onset = 0.81 V, E 1/2 = 0.77 V, and I dl = 1.31 mA/cm 2 for the C60 SWCNT15 , outperforming the C60 , SWCNTs and other C60 SWCNT n (n = 5 and 10 min), though still slightly inferior to the Pt/C electrode. Furthermore, Figure 3c shows results from the chronoamperometric test under 0.6 V with continuous O2  ﬂow in the phosphate buﬀer solution for the C60 -SWCNT electrode, revealing only a 6.3% reduction in current from the initial state after a 20 h, which is lower than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (a 9.9% loss) under the same condition. As shown in the inset of Figure 3c, the corresponding LSV curves for the C60 -SWCNTs remained almost unchanged, indicating that the C60 -SWCNTs is also slightly more stable than the commercial Pt/C electrode toward ORR at the neutral pH.',\n",
       " 9: 'We also tested the OER and HER performance of the C60 SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) catalysts in the phosphate buﬀer solution. For comparison, pure C60 , pure SWCNTs, Pt/ C (20 wt%, Johnson Matthey), and RuO 2 were also measured under the same conditions. Figures 3d and S14 show 970, 720, 770, 620, and 480 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for the pure C60 , pure SWCNTs, C60 -SWCNT5 , C60 -SWCNT10 , and commercial RuO2 , respectively (see also Table S5). In contrast, the C60 SWCNT 15 electrocatalyst exhibited a relatively low overpotential of 520 mV at 10 mA cm −2 with a low onset overpotential of 230 mV (Figure 3d). Notably, the current density of C 60 -SWCNT at an overpotential of 600 mV is 20.0 mA cm−2 , which is 14.115 and 3.5 times higher than those of the pure C 60 (1.4 mA cm−2 ) and SWCNTs (5.8 mA cm−2 ), respectively, and even superior to the commercial RuO 2 (15.5 mA cm −2 ). The C 60 -SWCNT showed a Tafel slope of 129 mV dec −1 (Figure 3e), which15 is comparable to that of the commercial RuO (141.1 mV dec −1 ), but much lower than those of the pure 2 C 60 (848.2 mV dec −1 ) and SWCNTs (848.2 and 468.1 mV dec −1 ). As expected, Figure S15 shows the smallest charge-transfer resistance for C60 -SWCNT 15 among the pure C60 , SWCNTs, C60 -SWCNT5 , and C60 -SWCNT10 . As can be seen in Figure 3f, the catalytic activity of C60 -SWCNT15,  along with the LSV curves (inset of Figure 3f), remained almost unchanged for more than 7.5 h. These results suggest that C60 -SWCNT 15 also exhibited an unprecedentedly remarkable catalytic activity and stability toward the OER in the neutral medium.',\n",
       " 10: 'Figures 3g and S16 show the HER LSV curves for all the samples investigated in this study in the neutral phosphate buﬀer solution. As expected, the pure C 60 has negligible electrocatalytic activity toward HER, and Pt/C showed the best performance with nearly zero overpotential. C60 SWCNT 15 exhibited a sharply rising current density with increasing negative potential and a low onset overpotential of 60 mV, suggesting a high HER catalytic activity for the C60 SWCNT15 . For comparison, the C60 -SWCNT 15 exhibited an overpotentials of 329 mV at 10 mA cm−2 , while the corresponding overpotentials for the pure SWCNTs, C60 - SWCNT5 , and C60 -SWCNT 10 are 738, 420, and 327 mV, respectively (Table S6). Figure 3h shows the Tafel slopes for the Pt/C electrocatalyst (76.7 mV dec −1 ), C 60 -SWCNT 15 (166.1 mV dec−1 ), and pure SWCNTs (236.9 mV dec−1 ) in the neutral medium. The steady-state current density of the C60 -SWCNT 15 shows a small change (8.8%) even after 15 h (Figure 3i), even smaller than the corresponding value of 12% for the Pt/C catalyst, along with the almost unchanged LSV curves for the C60 -SWCNT 15 (inset of Figure 3i). Clearly, therefore, the C60 -SWCNT 15 is also a good metal-free HER catalyst in the neutral medium.',\n",
       " 11: 'The OER performance of C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) catalysts was also measured in 0.5 M H2 SO4 , for comparison with pure C60 , SWCNTs, and commercial RuO 2 catalyst (Table S7). Figures 4a and S17 show an onset potential of ∼1.26 V for the C60 -SWCNT15 , which represents an overpotential of ∼420 mV and is even lower than that of RuO2  catalyst (∼1.28 V, overpotential ∼430 mV). The Tafel slope shown in Figure 4b for the C60 2 -SWCNT 15 is 38.4 mV dec −1 , which is similar to that of RuO catalyst (37.4 mV dec −1 ). The steady-state current density of the C60 -SWCNT 15 showed a small change (5.0%) even after 1.5 h in 0.5 M H2 SO 4 (Figure 4c), similar to the corresponding value of 5.4% for the commercial RuO 2 catalyst, along with the almost unchanged LSV curves for the C60 -SWCNT 15 (inset of Figure 4c). These results indicate a good stability for C60 -SWCNT 15 toward OER, even in the acidic medium. The electrocatalytic performance of the C60 -SWCNT electrode for HER were also measured with a three-electrode conﬁguration in 0.5 M H2 SO4 . As can be seen in Figures 4d and S18, the pure C60  showed almost no catalytic activity, while SWCNT electrode exhibited much better catalytic performance with an onset potential of ∼145 mV and overpotential of 1015 mV at 10 mA cm −2 for HER in the acidic medium. Surprisingly, the C60 SWCNT n (n = 0, 5, 10, and 15 min) electrodes showed much improved electrocatalytic performance, in respect to both pure C 60 and SWCNTs, with a relatively low onset potential of ∼108 and 320 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm −2 current (Figure 4d, Table S8). As displayed in Figure 4e, the Tafel slope of C 60 -SWCNT 15 for HER is 73.2 mV dec −1 , which is the smallest among those for the pure C 60 (568 mV dec −1 ) and SWCNTs electrocatalysts (118.2 mV dec −1 ). The observed low Tafel slope indicates a fast HER process for C60 SWCNT15 . The fast OER and HER reaction kinetics of C60 SWCNT 15 is also reﬂected by the smallest charge-transfer resistance for C60 -SWCNT 15 among the pure C60 , SWCNTs, and C60 -SWCNT n (n = 0, 5, 10, and 15 min) (Figure S19). The steady-state current density of the C60 -SWCNT 15 showed a small change (2.9%) after 20 h (Figure 4f), even smaller than the corresponding value of 4.4% for the commercial Pt/C catalyst, along with the almost unchanged LSV curves for the C60 -SWCNT 15 before and after the chronoamperometric test (inset of Figure 4f). Thus, the C60 -SWCNT 15 also showed a superior stability to the Pt/C toward HER in acidic medium. Table 1 summarizes electrocatalytic properties for the C60 SWCNT 15 at various pHs.',\n",
       " 12: 'To demonstrate potential applications for the C60 SWCNT15 , we investigated a two-electrode electrochemical water-splitting setup, in which the C60 -SWCNT 15 was used as both anode and cathode for OER and HER, respectively, in several diﬀerent electrolyte solutions (e.g., 0.1 M KOH, phosphate buﬀer solution, and 0.5 M H2 SO4 ). As seen in Figure S21a, the C60 -SWCNT 15 HER electrode (with the same C60 -SWCNT 15 as the OER counter electrode) showed a small onset potential of −210 mV and a gradually increased current density with increasing potential. In conjunction with the other half of the water-splitting OER reaction (Figure S21b), the galvanostatic cycling method demonstrated an attractive two electrode water-splitting process for the setup based on the C60 -SWCNT 15 bifunctional catalysts, which is comparable to its counterpart based on the Pt/C for ORR and RuO 2 for OER. Similar to the control setup, Figure S21c shows a good operation stability for the electrochemical water-splitting setup, in which the C60 -SWCNT 15 was used as both the anode and cathode for OER and HER, respectively. H 2 bubbles generated from the C60 -SWCNT 15 electrode during the water-splitting process could easily leave from the electrode surface (inset Figure S21c) to ensure a long-term stability. C60 -SWCNT15  was also found to show superior water-splitting performance in acidic and neutral media (see Figures S22 and S23).',\n",
       " 13: 'To gain a better mechanistic understanding of the observed electrocatalytic activities for C60 -SWCNT 15 catalysts, we performed energy level diagram analyses (Figure S24). As can be seen in Figure S24, the LUMO level of C 60 (−4.46 eV) matches well with the energy level for the HER and ORR while the HOMO level of the SWCNTs (−6.38 eV) is favorable for the OER. The bandgaps of the SWCNTs (6.38 to 4.34 eV)25  and C 60 (6.30 to 4.46 eV) 26 are in the visible region. Therefore, the formation of the C60 -SWCNTs junction enabled the observed metal-free electrocatalysis for HER, ORR, and OER as well as the use of visible light to aﬀect the electrocatalytic performance of C60 -SWCNTs.',\n",
       " 14: 'To investigate the possible light eﬀects, we used 404.7579.0 nm visible light (mercury lamp, 1.0 W cm−2 ) to excite the C60 -SWCNT15 . Indeed, it was found that exposure of C60 SWCNT 15 to visible light enhanced electrocatalytic activities for ORR/HER/OER in O2 -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution and in phosphate buﬀer solution (Figures S25 and S26). However, the ORR/HER/OER performance of pure C 60 and SWCNTs remained unchanged even when they were exposed to the same visible light under the same conditions (Figures S27S29). Furthermore, the photoinduced current enhancements for the C60 -SWCNT 15 were found to be highly reversible and reproducible (Figures S30−S32), showing great potential for practical photoelectrocatalysis. The above observed photoenhanced electrocatalytic currents are not inconsistent with the photoinduced reduction in the charge-transfer resistance of C60 -SWCNT15 , as shown in Figure S33, both of which are, most probably, arising from the light-induced charge-transfer between the intimately contacted C 60 and SWCNTs (cf. Figure S24).'}"

      "Extracting: In a typical experiment, the adsorption of C 60 onto SWCNTs was carried out by simply dispersing SWCNTs in an aqueous solution of C 60 for different durations (denoted as C60-SWCNTn , n = 5, 10, 15, and 20 min; see Experimental Section). The content of C 60 in C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15, and 20 min) was monitored by UV−vis absorption measurements. As shown in Figure 1b, the intensities of the characteristic absorption bands of the C 60 solution at 277 and 360 nm, 19 respectively, decreased with increasing n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min), indicating that an increased number of C60  molecules were adsorbed onto the SWCNT in C60 -SWCNTn  samples with increasing adsorption time (Figure 1c). Over adsorption for 15 min, however, the C 60 adsorption bands remained unchanged (e.g., C60 -SWCNT15 , C60 -SWCNT 20 in Figure 1b,c), suggesting that the adsorption of C 60 onto the surface of SWCNTs was saturated after 15 min adsorption in this particular case, and hence the similar amount of adsorbed C 60 for both the C60 -SWCNT 15 and C60 -SWCNT20 .

Compared to the C 1s XPS peak for pure C60 , the C 1s XPS peak positions for C60 -SWCNT n (n = 0, 5, 10, and 15 min) show a negative shift to lower binding energies with increasing adsorption time n (Figure 1e), indicating the occurrence of charge-transfer from the SWCNTs to C60 . 9d The observed intermolecular charge-transfer was also supported by Raman spectroscopic measurements carried out for the pure SWCNTs before and after adsorption with C60 .

Table 1 summarizes electrocatalytic properties for the C60 SWCNT 15 at various pHs.To demonstrate potential applications for the C60 SWCNT15 , we investigated a two-electrode electrochemical water-splitting setup, in which the C60 -SWCNT 15 was used as both anode and cathode for OER and HER, respectively, in several diﬀerent electrolyte solutions (e.g., 0.1 M KOH, phosphate buﬀer solution, and 0.5 M H2 SO4 ). As seen in Figure S21a, the C60 -SWCNT 15 HER electrode (with the same C60 -SWCNT 15 as the OER counter electrode) showed a small onset potential of −210 mV and a gradually increased current density with increasing potential. In conjunction with the other half of the water-splitting OER reaction (Figure S21b), the galvanostatic cycling method demonstrated an attractive two electrode water-splitting process for the setup based on the C60 -SWCNT 15 bifunctional catalysts, which is comparable to its counterpart based on the Pt/C for ORR and RuO 2 for OER. Similar to the control setup, Figure S21c shows a good operation stability for the electrochemical water-splitting setup, in which the C60 -SWCNT 15 was used as both the anode and cathode for OER and HER, respectively.

      "Extracting: To demonstrate potential applications for the C60 SWCNT15 , we investigated a two-electrode electrochemical water-splitting setup, in which the C60 -SWCNT 15 was used as both anode and cathode for OER and HER, respectively, in several diﬀerent electrolyte solutions (e.g., 0.1 M KOH, phosphate buﬀer solution, and 0.5 M H2 SO4 ). As seen in Figure S21a, the C60 -SWCNT 15 HER electrode (with the same C60 -SWCNT 15 as the OER counter electrode) showed a small onset potential of −210 mV and a gradually increased current density with increasing potential. In conjunction with the other half of the water-splitting OER reaction (Figure S21b), the galvanostatic cycling method demonstrated an attractive two electrode water-splitting process for the setup based on the C60 -SWCNT 15 bifunctional catalysts, which is comparable to its counterpart based on the Pt/C for ORR and RuO 2 for OER. Similar to the control setup, Figure S21c shows a good operation stability for the electrochemical water-splitting setup, in which the C60 -SWCNT 15 was used as both the anode and cathode for OER and HER, respectively. H 2 bubbles generated from the C60 -SWCNT 15 electrode during the water-splitting process could easily leave from the electrode surface (inset Figure S21c) to ensure a long-term stability. C60 -SWCNT15  was also found to show superior water-splitting performance in acidic and neutral media (see Figures S22 and S23).To gain a better mechanistic understanding of the observed electrocatalytic activities for C60 -SWCNT 15 catalysts, we performed energy level diagram analyses (Figure S24). As can be seen in Figure S24, the LUMO level of C 60 (−4.46 eV) matches well with the energy level for the HER and ORR while the HOMO level of the SWCNTs (−6.38 eV) is favorable for the OER. The bandgaps of the SWCNTs (6.38 to 4.34 eV)25  and C 60 (6.30 to 4.46 eV) 26 are in the visible region. Therefore, the formation of the C60 -SWCNTs junction enabled the observed metal-free electrocatalysis for HER, ORR, and OER as well as the use of visible light to aﬀect the electrocatalytic performance of C60 -SWCNTs.\n",

Indeed, it was found that exposure of C60 SWCNT 15 to visible light enhanced electrocatalytic activities for ORR/HER/OER in O2 -saturated 0.1 M KOH solution and in phosphate buﬀer solution (Figures S25 and S26). However, the ORR/HER/OER performance of pure C 60 and SWCNTs remained unchanged even when they were exposed to the same visible light under the same conditions (Figures S27S29). Furthermore, the photoinduced current enhancements for the C60 -SWCNT 15 were found to be highly reversible and reproducible (Figures S30−S32), showing great potential for practical photoelectrocatalysis. The above observed photoenhanced electrocatalytic currents are not inconsistent with the photoinduced reduction in the charge-transfer resistance of C60 -SWCNT15 , as shown in Figure S33, both of which are, most probably, arising from the light-induced charge-transfer between the intimately contacted C 60 and SWCNTs (cf. Figure S24).\n",

       "' with increasing adsorption time n (Figure 1e), indicating the occurrence of charge-transfer from the SWCNTs to C60 . 9d The observed intermolecular charge-transfer was also supported by Raman spectroscopic measurements carried out for the pure SWCNTs before and after adsorption with C60 . As expected, the Raman spectrum of SWCNTs displays two prominent peaks at ∼1611 and ∼1344 cm −1 corresponding to the G- and D-bands, respectively, while Raman spectrum of C 60 shows only one peak at ∼1643 cm−1 . Raman spectra of C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, and 15 min) exhibit a slight increase in the intensity ratio of the D-band to the G-band with increasing C60  adsorption time (Figure 1f), also accompanied by an upshift of the peak positions. While the upshift in the peak position supports the charge-transfer from SWCNTs to the electronwithdrawing C60 , the increase in the peak intensity ratio of the D-band to G-band (ID /IG ) for C60 -SWCNT n (n = 5, 10, 15 min) indicates that the nanotube structure became slightly more disordered via the adsorption-induced charge-transfer to C60 .\\n'"

You need to identify whether the sentences is describing properties of the main materials {main_topic}. If so, you need to extract the material name and all properties related. You need to be careful for materials that are developed under slightly different conditions, you should treat them as a new entity. For example, if you see carbon nanotube synthesized at 60 degree and 120 degree respectively, CNT@60 and CNT@120 would be two different materials, and their properties should be extracted separately. Also for the same material, if there are multiple measurements, you should extract all of them. You should always ignore Raman, XRD, FTIR, XPS, UV-vis, and other characterization techniques which provide spectrum analysis. You may also infer the properties of the materials from the text if they are not explicitly mentioned. For instance, the following sentence 'resultant C60-SWCNT n(n = 5, 10, and 15 min), which revealed a diameter of 1.2 nm for the SWCNT' indicates the diameter of the SWCNT(n=5, n=10 and n=15min) are all 1.2 nm.

    "Supercapacitors possessing multiple functions other than storing energy, such as bearing mechanical loads, are a promising technology for a wide range of applications. However, achieving both energy storage efficiency and mechanical strength/stiffness requires structurally strong electrolytes and high-capacitance electrodes. Herein, we report a novel method of synthesizing a high-mass loading of MnO2 on carbon nanotube (CNT) mats to create nanocomposite electrodes of high capacitance and mechanical properties. With CNTs acting as structural reinforcement for the pseudocapacitive MnO2 matrix, the resulting nanocomposite electrodes exhibited an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 2579 mF/cm2 at a current density of 1 mA/cm2 and excellent mechanical properties. These electrodes were then used to fabricate flexible and mechanically strong structural supercapacitors by infusing with a PVA gel electrolyte and a PEGDGE solid electrolyte, respectively. The resulting flexible supercapacitors yielded a high areal capacitance of 947 mF/cm2 while the structural supercapacitors gave a high tensile modulus of 6.1 GPa. These results demonstrated that the hierarchical MnO2/CNT electrodes could provide both excellent energy storage capability and structural stiffness and strength, expanding their applications beyond mono-functional supercapacitors.\n",
