Task: Extract and format key information from scientific research articles for database entry, which will be used for machine learning on catalyst design. You should focus on metal-free electrocatalysts materials and their properties.

Instructions:

Paragraph Analysis: Carefully read each paragraph provided from a scientific research article.

Material Identification: Identify the main material(s) mentioned in the paragraph. Focus specifically on metal-free and carbon-based electrocatalysts.

Property Extraction: Extract any important physical, chemical or electrochemical properties of these materials that are potentially important for machine learning on catalyst design, including but not limited to: overpotential, onset potential, Tafel slope.

Numeric Values: Exact figures mentioned in the text.
Units: The measurement units of these figures.
Notes Section: In the notes, document conditions under which these properties are measured. This includes current density, temperature, and specific reactions (e.g., ORR, OER).

JSON Formatting: Format the extracted information into a JSON structure with this hierarchy:

DOI: Use a placeholder value.
Text: Use a placeholder value (to be replaced manually later).
Materials: Array of material objects, each containing:
name: Name of the material.
properties: Array of property objects, each with:
property_name: Name of the property.
value: Numeric value of the property.
unit: Unit of measurement.
notes: Object containing key-value pairs of measurement conditions.

Only output JSON formatted results without any additional text since it will be used directly to insert into the MongoDB database.
