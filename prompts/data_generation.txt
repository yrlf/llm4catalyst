Objective: Generate synthetic training data (prompt-response pairs) for fine-tuning large language models, focusing on electrochemical reactions and catalysts.

Tasks:

1.Prompt Writing:
- Create comprehensive paragraphs, each with exactly 5 sentences, about electrochemical reactions and catalysts.
- Focus on various materials, exploring both relevant and irrelevant characteristics in the context of reactions.
- Format: Begin with "prompt\n-----------"

2.Content Requirements:
- Detail specific materials, including author's annotations.
- Discuss both relevant and irrelevant properties, like overpotential and onset potential.
- Note variations in properties under different conditions (e.g., CNT50's overpotentials in 1 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH).
- Employ diverse writing styles.

3. JSON Response Format:
- Begin with "response\n-----------", followed by the JSON response on a new line.
- Include only "overpotential" and "onset potential".
- Each property in the JSON to contain:
    - value: Numerical value.
    - unit: Measurement unit.
    - electrolyte: Specific electrolyte, e.g., '1 M KOH'.
    - reaction type: Type of electrochemical reaction, e.g., 'ORR'.
    - At the end of response, add a line of "***********" as a separator.

4. Example prompt-response pairs:
prompt
-----------
Graphitic Carbon Nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as a prominent metal-free catalyst in electrocatalysis. It exhibits an overpotential of 0.33 V in 1 M KOH for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), showcasing its efficiency. The onset potential for ORR in the same electrolyte was recorded at 0.78 V. g-C3N4's thermal stability and semiconductor properties, though intriguing, are secondary to its electrocatalytic capabilities. This material is particularly appealing for ORR due to its lower overpotential and eco-friendly nature.

{
  "name": "Graphitic Carbon Nitride",
  "properties": [
    {
      "overpotentials": [
        {
          "value": 0.33,
          "unit": "V",
          "electrolyte": "1 M KOH",
          "reaction type": "ORR"
        }
      ],
      "onset potentials": [
        {
          "value": 0.78,
          "unit": "V",
          "electrolyte": "1 M KOH",
          "reaction type": "ORR"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
***********

5. Managing Irrelevant Information:
- Despite discussing various properties, only include "overpotential" and "onset potential" in the JSON response.
- Exclude other properties mentioned in the text from the JSON.
- Strictly adhere to generating prompt-response pairs without additional text.

6. Goal:
- To create detailed, accurate training data on specific materials in electrochemical reactions.
- Focus on extracting "overpotential" and "onset potential" for JSON data, providing broader context in the paragraphs.
- These instructions aim for clear understanding and execution of the task, emphasizing the selective extraction of key properties for JSON responses amidst detailed paragraph discussions.
