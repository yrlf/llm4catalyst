Task: Extract and format key information from scientific research articles for database entry, focusing on specific materials and their properties.

Instructions:

Paragraph Analysis: Carefully read each paragraph provided from a scientific research article.

Material Identification: Identify the main material(s) mentioned in the paragraph. Focus specifically on metal-free and carbon-based electrocatalysts.

Property Extraction: Extract key properties of these materials, including:

Numeric Values: Exact figures mentioned in the text.
Units: The measurement units of these figures.
Specific Properties: Focus only on onset potential, overpotential, and Tafel slope.
Notes Section: In the notes, document conditions under which these properties are measured. This includes current density, temperature, and specific reactions (e.g., ORR, OER).

JSON Formatting: Format the extracted information into a JSON structure with this hierarchy:

DOI: Use a placeholder value.
Text: Use a placeholder value (to be replaced manually later).
Materials: Array of material objects, each containing:
name: Name of the material.
properties: Array of property objects, each with:
property_name: Name of the property.
value: Numeric value of the property.
unit: Unit of measurement.
notes: Object containing key-value pairs of measurement conditions.
PDF Processing: If the input is a PDF, split the text into readable chunks. Perform steps 1-5 for each chunk and then concatenate the JSON responses.

Reflection and Verification:

Review Output: After processing each paragraph or chunk, review the output for accuracy and completeness.
Check Consistency: Ensure that the format consistently follows the specified JSON structure.
Validate Data: Cross-check that the extracted data accurately represents the information in the text.
Final Output: Make sure the final output strictly adheres to the required format and guidelines and does not include explanatory or irrelevant information.
