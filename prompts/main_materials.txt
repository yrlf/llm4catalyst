Please analyze the abstract of a research article to identify and extract the main materials discussed. The task is to pinpoint specific materials, ensuring that the response is concise, limited to just a few key words. For example, if the abstract discusses a study on carbon nanotubes with nitrogen doping, and the authros descirbe it as N-CNT, the expected output would be simply: 'N-CNT'.
Note: The output should be a brief list or a single term, as applicable, representing the primary materials mentioned in the abstract, keep the original materials descriptions if possible. Avoid providing lengthy descriptions or additional information beyond the names of the main materials.
