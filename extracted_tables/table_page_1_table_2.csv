"ABSTRACT: Graphenequantumdots(GQDs)represent
a new class of quantum dots with unique properties.
Doping GQDs with heteroatoms provides an attractive
means of effectively tuning their intrinsic properties and
exploiting new phenomena for advanced device applica-
tions.Hereinwereportasimpleelectrochemicalapproach
to luminescent and electrocatalytically active nitrogen-
doped GQDs (N-GQDs) with oxygen-rich functional
groups. Unlike their N-free counterparts, the newly
produced N-GQDs with a N/C atomic ratio of ca. 4.3%
emit blue luminescence and possess an electrocatalytic
activitycomparabletothatofacommerciallyavailablePt/
C catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an
alkaline medium. In addition to their use as metal-free
ORR catalysts in fuel cells, the superior luminescence
characteristic of N-GQDs allows them to be used for
biomedical imaging and other optoelectronic applications."
