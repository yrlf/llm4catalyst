Presently, transition metal oxide based ORR/OER bifunctional catalysts have become promising alternatives due to the structural and compositional active sites of the oxygen evolving complex. However, their electrocatalytic ORR activities are unsatisfactory, possibly related to the strong bond strength between the OOH*/OH* intermediates and the metal active sites,17 along with poor electronic conductivity hampering the performance.18,19 It has been reported that doping with electron donors or supported on conducting materials can improve the conductivity, such as transition metal oxides with N-doped graphene as conducting materials.20,21,40 Recently, transition metals encapsulated in a carbon matrix were found to be conducive to improve the catalytic activity for the ORR/OER; Chen and co-workers reported that Fe nanoparticles encapsulated inside carbon nanotubes with appealing ORR and OER activity as advanced electrocatalysts.22 As reported in a series of studies, metal nanoparticles encapsulated in a carbon matrix possess a unique host–guest electronic interaction, which can tune the redox properties of the surrounding carbon layer, thus leading to the formation of catalytic functionalities.23 In addition, nitrogen-doping can further improve the catalytic activity, which can be ascribed to the synergistic catalytic effects of the metal nanoparticles and the N dopants,24 such as Co-incorporated N-doped reduced graphene oxide,25 Co-containing N-doped carbon aerogels26 and Co-embedded in N-doped carbon.27 In view of the need for bifunctional catalysts towards the ORR and OER for rechargeable metal–air batteries and URFCs, doping multiple components in a base catalyst such as carbon nanotubes is very necessary. On the one hand, the composites based on carbon can ameliorate the catalyst degradation by hosting the active sites and reducing the electric resistance of catalysts; on the other hand, the doping atom can provide more active sites for the ORR and OER.
Herein, we report the synthesis of transition metal (Fe, Co, and Ni) nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (M/N-CNTs, M = Fe, Co, and Ni) via a solid-state thermal reaction. The precursors are suitable for large-scale fabrication due to their easy accessibility. The metal nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic layers are dispersed at the endpoint of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes. Due to the protection of graphitic layers, the metal nanoparticles are chemically stable, and thus the catalysts show superior long-term stability. The optimized Co/N-CNT catalyst shows the highest efficiency and robust performance towards both the ORR and OER under alkaline conditions, which can serve as a highly active electrocatalyst towards both the OER and ORR with long-term stability.
