In most Fe–N–C catalysts, Fe–N4 moieties are considered as the active sites to mainly contribute the ORR performance.9,10 However, during the synthesis, high-temperature pyrolysis treatment is normally required for the formation of Fe–N4 moieties, for which less active and large Fe-containing particles can easily precipitate.11,12 Hence, much effort has been devoted to making the structure of Fe–N–C catalysts as ideal as possible. One such ideal structure is the so-called single-metal atom catalysts (SACs) with the maximum utilization of all active metal sites.13–15 However, acid treatment is usually involved in the synthesis process to etch Fe-containing nanoparticles, which in turn corrodes the catalytic sites as well.13,15,16 Surprisingly, it has been recently found that certain Fe-containing nanoparticles can actually contribute high ORR activity, such as specially designed Fe–N–C catalysts with ultra-fine Fe-containing nanoparticles whose activity can be even higher than that of SACs.17–19 Naturally, open questions arise, for example: (1) why can the ultra-fine Fe-containing nanoparticles boost the ORR activity? (2) What is the exact molecular structure in the nanoparticle that really plays the key role in the catalysis? To address these questions, rational design and structure-controllable synthesis are developed to achieve high-performance Fe–N–C catalysts, while combined experimental and theoretical analysis can be utilized to gain deeper molecular-level insights into the underlying catalytic mechanism with the newly designed Fe–N–C catalysts.15,20
Here, we report a new design of three-dimensional (3D) porous N-doped carbon networks with evenly distributed Fe-containing nanocrystals (named FeNCNs) as a high-performance catalyst towards the ORR. The electrochemical evaluation shows high electrocatalytic activity for the ORR in alkaline media with high durability. Especially, a half-wave potential of 0.890 V (vs. RHE) is achieved, which is comparable/superior to that of most Fe/N-functionalized carbon catalysts reported to date (Table S1†). The remarkable electrocatalytic performance stems from the 3D porous architecture with not only numerous active sites for catalysis but also newly found synergistic effects between the Fe–N4 moieties and Fe4N support. The present fabrication of FeNCNs is facile using cheap and eco-friendly metals and materials, thereby meeting the requirements for large-scale fabrication and wide application.
