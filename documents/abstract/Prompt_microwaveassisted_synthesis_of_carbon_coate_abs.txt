•
Microwave-assisted hydrothermal carbonization approach is used for the synthesis.
•
Hard carbons and Si-hard carbons are obtained from glucose and glucosamine.
•
Glucosamine is the source of N-doped carbons.
•
Enhanced lithium storage is obtained with the carbon source of glucosamine.
•
Volume expansion of Si is prevented via the carbon coating.
