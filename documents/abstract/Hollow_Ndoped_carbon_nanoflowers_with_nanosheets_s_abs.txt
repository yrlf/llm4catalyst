•
Hollow N-doping carbon nanoflowers (h-N-CFs-800) are successfully prepared.
•
Covalent complexes act as calcination precursors and activated nitrogen sources.
•
Hollow and porous structure of h-N-CFs-800 increase the number of active sites.
•
The high ORR activity due to the unique hollow structure and abundant N doping.
•
h-N-CFs-800 has excellent ORR activity in both alkaline and neutral electrolytes.
