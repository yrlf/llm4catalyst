•
Zr-doping Co3O4 electrocatalysts were fabricated on nickel foam.
•
Zr-doping Co3O4 weave-like nanoarray exhibits excellent alkaline OER activity.
•
The free energy of potential rate-determining step is reduced.
•
Morphology and electronic structure of Co3O4 were optimized by Zr doping.
•
The design of the experiment can be guided and predicted via DFT calculations.
