Graphical Abstract
Oxygen producer: Novel ultrathin 2D Co3O4-based nanocomposites with 0D CS, 1D CNTs and 2D rGO were prepared through a facile one-pot hydrothermal strategy. The as-prepared Co3O4/nanocarbon composites showed enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. In particular, the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO composites exhibited an overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm−2 together with great stability. This work provides new insight for the design of highly efficient OER catalyst.
Abstract
The efficient catalytic oxidation of water to dioxygen plays a significant role in solar fuel and artificial photosynthetic systems. It remains highly challenging to develop oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity and low cost under mild conditions. Here, a new composite material is reported based on ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets and reduced graphene oxides (rGO) by means of a one-pot hydrothermal strategy. The ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite shows superior stability under alkaline conditions and exhibits an overpotential of 290 mV with a Tafel slope of 68 mA dec−1, which is much smaller than that of bare Co3O4 catalyst. Extensive experiments were also carried out using 0D CS and 1D CNTs (CS=carbon spheres, CNTs=carbon nanotubes) in place of the 2D rGO. The overpotentials of as-prepared nanocomposites decrease with the increase of the dimension of nanocarbons, suggesting the electrochemistry activity is closely related to the surface area of carbon substrates. In addition, compared with ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets with a Co2+/Co3+ ratio of 1.2, the as-prepared ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite with a Co2+/Co3+ ratio of 1.4 contributes to the better OER performance as more oxygen vacancies can be formed in the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite under the experimental conditions. Compared with other Co3O4-containing composite materials reported so far, the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposites show excellent OER performance.
