•
Series of cation-doped Co3O4 nanoarrays with same morphology are synthesized.
•
Experiments and DFT simulations reveal the valence regulation of Co cation.
•
CCO catalyst exhibits the lowest OER overpotential as lower valence state of Cu.
•
Controllable morphology benefits to theoretically study of the real catalysts.
