•
The n-Si@G-C composite is synthesized by a carbothermal shock by microwave induction.
•
This offers an efficient, non-contact powder process for cost-effective mass production.
•
The n-Si@G-C anode demonstrates both a high reversible capacity and fast-charging capability.
•
A full-cell exhibits a high capacity retention (71.3%) under 3C charging after 300 cycles
