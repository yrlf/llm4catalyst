•
A solution phase is developed to create oxygen vacancies on thin cobalt oxide nanoplates.
•
The concentration of oxygen vacancies on nanoplates surface can be fine-tuned.
•
The OER performance is highly dependent on the concentration of oxygen vacancies.
•
Excellent OER performance is obtained by controlling the surface oxygen vacancies.
