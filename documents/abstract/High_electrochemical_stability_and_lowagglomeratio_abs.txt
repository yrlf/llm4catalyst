•
Cobalt oxide nanoparticles are synthesized on the surface of nitrogen doped carbon.
•
The hybrid composite enhances the conductivity, charge transfer and generate additional defect active sites.
•
The N-ACS@Co3O4 exhibits a superior OER activity and exceptional long-term durability.
•
DFT calculations demonstrate a strong adsorption of Co3O4 on N-doped graphene.
•
The strong adsorption of Co3O4 prevents its agglomeration, and improves the stability.
