•
A 1D Ni@NCNTs with confined the Ni NPs inside NCNTs was successfully fabricated.
•
The hybrid exhibited superior electrochemical CO2ER activity and selectivity.
•
The confinement effect of Ni@NCNTs contributed to enhanced electrochemical performance.
•
DFT calculations revealed the weak binding strengths between Ni NPs and *CO intermediates enhancing the kinetics in CO2ER.
