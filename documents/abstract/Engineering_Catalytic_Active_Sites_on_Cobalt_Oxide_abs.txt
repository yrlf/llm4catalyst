Abstract
Tuning the catalytic active sites plays a crucial role in developing low cost and highly durable oxygen electrode catalysts with precious metal-competitive activity. In an attempt to engineer the active sites in Co3O4 spinel for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline electrolyte, herein, controllable synthesis of surface-tailored Co3O4 nanocrystals including nanocube (NC), nanotruncated octahedron (NTO), and nanopolyhedron (NP) anchored on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO), through a facile and template-free hydrothermal strategy, is provided. The as-synthesized Co3O4 NC, NTO, and NP nanostructures are predominantly enclosed by {001}, {001} + {111}, and {112} crystal planes, which expose different surface atomic configurations of Co2+ and Co3+ active sites. Electrochemical results indicate that the unusual {112} plane enclosed Co3O4 NP on rGO with abundant Co3+ sites exhibit superior bifunctional activity for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, as well as enhanced metalâ€“air battery performance in comparison with other counterparts. Experimental and theoretical simulation studies demonstrate that the surface atomic arrangement of Co2+/Co3+ active sites, especially the existence of octahedrally coordinated Co3+ sites, optimizes the adsorption, activation, and desorption features of oxygen species. This work paves the way to obtain highly active, durable, and cost-effective electrocatalysts for practical clean energy devices through regulating the surface atomic configuration and catalytic active sites.
