•
Ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheet with oxygen vacancies via hydrothermal and pre-oxidation.
•
Oxygen vacancies are formed by preoxidation of Co-based precursors.
•
Exhibited small overpotential of 367 mV for 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 65 mV/dec for OER.
•
Showed excellent electrochemical stability in alkaline.
