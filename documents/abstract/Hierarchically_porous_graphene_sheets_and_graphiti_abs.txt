It is commonly accepted that introducing nitrogen into a carbon matrix is a key step to synthesize highly active metal-free ORR catalysts.6b Despite the controversy on the exact role of the nitrogen heteroatom in ORR, both quantum mechanical calculations7 and experimental observations8 reveal that incorporation of nitrogen, especially the pyridinic or/and graphitic species, induces a positive charge on the adjacent carbon, which can facilitate oxygen adsorption and subsequently weaken the O–O bond in the adsorbed oxygen molecules. In this regard, graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) – stacked two dimensional (2D) heptazine (C6N7) sheets connected by tertiary amines – may serve as a promising metal-free ORR catalyst owing to its high nitrogen content (60.9 wt% in theory and mainly of pyridinic/graphitic nature) and stable molecular structure.9
Unfortunately, the electrocatalytic activity of pristine GCN is restricted by its semi-conductive nature (<10−2 S cm−1), which obstructs electron transfer during the ORR process.10 Thus introducing electron-conductive carbon materials as substrates should be a general strategy to improve the ORR performance of GCN. First-principles studies on the ORR capability of GCN have shown that if sufficient electrons are available in the GCN–O2 system, the ORR could occur via a direct four-electron (4e−) pathway, rather than the two-step two-electron (2e−) pathway for the pristine GCN.11 The first experimental attempt of carbon-supported GCN composites was to mechanically blend GCN with carbon black (CB).12 The GCB/CB composites showed much improved onset potential and reduction current density, compared with pristine GCN, as a result of the increased conductivity and surface area derived from the carbon black support.12 To further clarify the role of substrates, ordered porous carbon materials, such as CMK-3, were then adopted as their morphology and structures were easy to control.11 It was shown that incorporation of GCN into CMK-3 led to a direct 4e− pathway, consistent with the theoretical prediction.11 However, the small mesopores in CMK-3 may not be capable of fast mass exchange during ORR and the catalytic activity of GCN@CMK-3 was thus worse than that of the commercial Pt/C. From this point of view, uniform GCN embedded porous carbon (GCN/C) composites with a tuneable pore size have been prepared.13 The ORR activity of macroporous GCN/C with a pore size of 150 nm was shown superior to that of the mesoporous GCN/C with a pore size of 12 nm obtained via a similar synthesis route. The macroporous GCN/C facilitated the oxygen diffusion, and led to a much smaller Tafel slope value in the high overpotential region than that of the mesoporous sample. However the overall electron transfer number for this macroporous composite was only three, indicating a combined 2e− and 4e− reaction pathway, which was probably due to the low specific surface area and the lack of exposed active sites.13 So far, none of the aforementioned carbon-supported GCN composites can show both fast ORR kinetics and excellent selectivity of 4e− catalysis pathway.
Compared with carbon-based supports, 2D graphene sheets (GSs) are expected to be better substrates, given the excellent electron collection and transport properties of GSs and their structural similarity to GCN.6b,14 One latest theoretical investigation demonstrated that the π–π interaction at the interface of hybrid GS/GCN composites could force electrons to transfer from GS to GCN and accumulate on the active sites in GCN, which was predicted to significantly enhance the ORR catalytic activity.15 However the early investigation of immobilizing GCN on GS only showed limited improvement – the ORR occurred via a 3e− pathway with reduction current density slightly lower than that of the home-made platinum-loaded graphene composite.10 Such an improvement was below expectation because only the effect of conductivity was considered and the GCN loading ratio (the amount of active materials) was low (ca. 10 wt% nitrogen). In addition, the layered morphology was unfavourable for ORR due to the limited exposure of active sites and the inefficient mass transport and access.10 Inspired by that, here for the first time, we experimentally synthesized GS/GCN intercalated composites with hierarchical porosity. The ORR activity was first optimised by balancing two intrinsic parameters – active sites and conductivity. After further taking into account of mass transport, the obtained hierarchically porous GS/GCN intercalated composites showed fast reduction kinetics and 100% ORR catalysis selectivity, with better long-term stability and stronger tolerance against methanol than the commercial Pt/C catalysts. To the best of our knowledge, such excellent catalytic activities outperformed any other existing GCN-based ORR catalysts.10–13,16
