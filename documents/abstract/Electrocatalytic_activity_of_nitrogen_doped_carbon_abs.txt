Nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) were synthesized by a single step chemical vapor deposition technique using either ferrocene or iron(II) phthalocyanine as catalyst and pyridine as the carbon and nitrogen precursor. Variations in surface morphology and electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were observed between the NCNTs synthesized using different catalysts. The structural and chemical characterizations were carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical activity of NCNTs was evaluated with rotating ring disc electrode (RRDE) voltammetry. Structural characterization suggested more defects formed on the NCNTs synthesized from ferrocene (Fc-NCNTs) which led to a rugged surface morphology compared to the NCNTs synthesized from iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc-NCNTs). Based on the RRDE voltammetry study, Fc-NCNTs demonstrated much higher activity for ORR than FePc-NCNT. Evidences from the structural and chemical characterizations illustrate the potential impact of catalyst structure in shaping the surface structure of NCNTs and the positive effect of surface defects on ORR activity. These results showed that potential improvements on ORR activity of NCNTs could be achieved by tailoring the surface structure of NCNTs by using catalysts with different structures.
