Abstract
We report a high performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst based on vertically aligned, nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (VA-NCNT) arrays. Characterization in conditions analogous to the operation of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell show ORR taking place on the catalyst at a favorable reduction potential with a superior current density and greater rate constant.
