•
Highly active N-doped graphene/carbon nanotube composite catalysts are synthesised.
•
Electrocatalytic ORR activity for different nitrogen-doped composites is compared.
•
The reasons for the difference in the ORR activity are discussed.
•
The stability of the N-doped nanocarbons during 1000 potential cycles is assessed.
