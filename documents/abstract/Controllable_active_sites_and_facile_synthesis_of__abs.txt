Development of efficient and promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions is desirable. Herein, cobalt nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@NSCNT) were prepared by a facile pyrolytic treatment. The cobalt nanoparticles and co-doping of nitrogen and sulfur can improve the electron donor-acceptor characteristics of the carbon nanotubes and provide more active sites for catalytic oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The prepared Co@NSCNT, annealed at 900 Â°C, showed excellent electrocatalytic performance and better durability than commercial platinum catalysts. Additionally, Co@NSCNT-900 catalysts exhibited comparable onset potentials and Tafel slopes to ruthenium oxide. Overall, Co@NSCNT showed high activity and improved durability for both oxygen evolution and reduction reactions.
