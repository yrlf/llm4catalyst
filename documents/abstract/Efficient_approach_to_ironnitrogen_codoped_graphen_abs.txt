Our present task focused on exploring new methods for efficiently codoping heteroatoms and transition metals in graphene. Given that reduced graphene oxide (rG) is one of the most easily-available derivatives of graphene, featuring good conductivity and a large specific surface area, herein we report a new synthetic method for the formation of cyclopentadienyliron (CpFe) modified rG (rGFeCp) and CpFe modified few-layer graphene nanosheets (GFeCp) by convenient ligand-exchange reactions of ferrocene with rG and graphite, respectively. The as-prepared rGFeCp and GFeCp were further pyrolyzed under nitrogen and activated under ammonia at different temperatures to produce a series of graphene composites with high nitrogen/iron doping contents (the highest values are N: 2.94 at% and Fe: 1.84 at%). The resulting materials exhibited porous structures and sheet-like morphologies. These materials facilitate ORR catalysis in alkaline media with a good performance (e.g. a primary four electron transfer mechanism) that is comparable with that of commercial Pt/C catalysts.28,29
