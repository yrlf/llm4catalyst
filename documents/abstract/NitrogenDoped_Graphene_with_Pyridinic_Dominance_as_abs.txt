Abstract
The nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) with dominance of the pyridinic-N configuration is synthesized via a straightforward process including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of graphene and postdoping with a solid nitrogen precursor of graphitic C3N4 at elevated temperature. The NG fabricated from CVD-grown graphene contains a high N content up to 6.5 at. % when postdoped at 800 °C but maintains high crystalline quality of graphene. The obtained NG exhibits high activity, long-standing stability, and outstanding crossover resistance for electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline medium. The NG treated at 800 °C shows the best ORR performance. Further study of the dependence of ORR activity on different N functional groups in these metal-free NG electrodes provides deeper insights into the origin of ORR activity. Our results reveal that the pyridinic-N tends to be the most active N functional group to facilitate ORR at low overpotential via a four-electron pathway.
