•
Porous rod-like, mixed rod and sheet-like, and sheet-like of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanostructures were prepared.
•
The morphologies and crystal structures of Co3O4 were controlled by adjusting the urea concentration.
•
The Co3O4 nanosheets showed the highest catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction.
