Designing an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media is highly needed but very challenging task. Herein, we used organic polyelectrolytes such as (carboxymethyl cellulose) CMC and polyacrylamide polymers for the growth of Co3O4 nanostructures by aqueous chemical growth method. The morphology and composition studies were performed on scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) techniques. The structural properties and the surface chemistry of the Co3O4 electrocatalysts were correlated to the OER performance, and the enhancement mechanism with respect to pristine Co3O4 was observed to be specifically related to the polyelectrolyte templating role.
