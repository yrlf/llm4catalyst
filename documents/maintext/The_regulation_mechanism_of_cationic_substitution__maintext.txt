Bimetallic Co-based spinel oxides have been regarded as promising electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whereas, the catalytic activity still needs to be improved, and the regulation mechanism of intrinsic activity by various cations substitution remains challenges due to nanoarray morphologies difference. Herein, well-organized nanoarrays of nickel-, copper-, zinc-cobalt spinel oxides (NCO, CCO, ZCO) and pristine Co3O4 with same microstructure are controllably fabricated. The time-dependent growth process of specific nanoarrays is investigated, as well as catalytic mechanism of enhanced OER activity. Cationic substitution promotes the OER activity and CCO possesses the best activity due to the highest Co valence. Theoretic simulations further validate the valence state of octahedral Co active sites increase most when doped with Cu ions, contributing to accelerated OER kinetics. Importantly, this work provides new insights to rationally design high-performance OER catalysts for matching experimental results and catalytic mechanism studies.

Developing clean and renewable energy sources is imperative in response to the increasing global energy crisis and related environmental problems. Hydrogen energy can be a promising alternative to the conventional fossil fuels due to its high calorific value and environmentally friendliness
[1]
,
[2]
. Electrochemical water splitting has been regarded as one of the sustainable energy technologies for hydrogen production, where the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode greatly restricts the overall efficiency due to the four-electron-involved process and large redox potential of O2/H2O

[5]
. Thereby, in order to accelerate the reaction rate and boost the catalytic efficiency, exploring highly active electrocatalysts is essential. Up to now, Ir- and Ru-based catalysts are deemed as the state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts, whereas the scarcity, high cost and poor catalytic durability severely hamper their large-scale application

[8]
. Huge efforts have been devoted to finding non-noble metal based electrocatalysts with earth-abundant elements, high efficiency, and durable property.
Among these candidate electrocatalysts, spinel cobalt oxide (Co3O4) has recently stimulated considerable attention for low cost, easy availability and corrosion stability toward OER, which possesses two crystallographic sites including Co3+ at octahedral (Oh) and Co2+ at tetrahedral (Td) sites

[11]
. Unfortunately, a high overpotential still needs to be conquered when reaching large current density for insufficient OER activity of monometallic oxides. Many strategies have focused on doping metallic cations, fabricating specific morphology, and selecting proper conductive substrates to improve the electrocatalytic activity

. Spinel bimetallic oxides (AxCo3-xO4, 0 < x ≤ 1, A represents the transition metals (TMs)) are usually generated when introducing another TM cation in Co3O4 and the geometric and electronic structures of octahedral Co cations can be effectively modulated for excellent OER catalytic performance

. The transition metals at A sites with different occupied electrons of 3d-orbits can efficiently maneuver coordination environment, valence states and orbital electrons distribution of active Co sites, offering an attractive avenue to manage the intrinsic activity. Transition metals such as Mn, Ni, Cu and Zn elements substituted bimetallic spinel AxCo3-xO4 oxides have corroborated enhanced OER activity

Beyond composition design, well-aligned spinel oxide nanoarrays directly grown on the current collectors enables good electrical conductivity and high structural stability, which have aroused extensive interests as highly effective electrodes. The open architecture within nanoarrays facilitates the electrolyte penetration and ion diffusion, benefiting to high utilization efficiency of active sites
[29]

[30]
. Meanwhile, the fabricated nanoarrays can expand the specific surface area and thus promote density of active sites with high accessibility for improved electrocatalytic performance. It should be noted that different morphologies of arrays such as nanoparticles, nanosheets and nanowires significantly affect OER activity for AxCo3-xO4 oxides. Although catalytic performance of these catalysts can be evaluated via normalized activity based on geometric surface area of electrodes, catalyst surface area or electrochemical active surface area, there are challenges to construct simulation models for representing the real catalysts and thus to reveal the intrinsic activity

. This encourages us to develop AxCo3-xO4 nanoarrays with same microstructure to determine the catalytic active sites and structure–activity relationship by experimental research, which also benefits to subsequently theoretical simulations to disclose the regulation mechanism of cationic substitution at atomic scale.
In this work, nickel-, copper-, zinc-substituted AxCo3-xO4 (marked as NCO, CCO, ZCO) and pristine Co3O4 nanoarrays with the same morphology were successfully grown on the conductive substrate of carbon cloth by hydrothermal method and subsequent low-temperature oxidation, and the time-dependent growth process of nanoarray morphology was also researched. Benefited from the specific microstructures that expose abundant active sites, and cations doping that regulates the electronic structure of active Co sites, NCO, CCO and ZCO all exhibit improved OER catalytic activity compared to Co3O4. In OER processes, CCO exhibits the best activity, followed by ZCO, NCO and Co3O4. Based on the same morphology of nanoarrays, the adjustable electronic structure of Co cations by different cationic substitution is analyzed. Both experimental and theoretic analysis prove the valence state of Co cations in Co3O4, NCO, ZCO and CCO increased successively, showing the same trend with the enhancement of OER activity, which demonstrates that Co cations are the dominant active sites for OER and higher valence Co sites contribute to higher catalytic activity. These results can provide an effective approach to explore the regulation mechanism of the multiple bimetallic catalysts based on the controlled morphology.
The carbon cloth was cut into piece of 2 cm × 4 cm and cleaned to remove the impurities from the surface of carbon cloth substrate by sonication in acetone, ethanol, and distilled water for 30 min, respectively. In order to activate and enhance the hydrophilia of carbon cloth, the cleaned carbon cloth was oxidized by sonication in 40 % nitric acid for another 30 min. Afterwards, the oxidized carbon cloth was cleaned under ultrasonic in distilled water thrice and each time for a duration of 5 min. Finally, the pretreated carbon cloth was kept in distilled water for further spare.
The waxberry-like CuCo oxy-spinel catalysts were grown on carbon cloth by a facile hydrothermal process and subsequent calcination under low temperature. In detail, 4 mmol of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 8 mmol of NH4F, 20 mmol of urea and different molar weight of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (2, 3 and 4 mmol) were dispersed into 40 mL distilled water and stirred until a homogeneous solution formed. Then transferring the above solution to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, followed by a piece of pretreated carbon cloth immersed in the solution. After the autoclave had been kept at 120 °C for 5 h, the copper-cobalt precursor was taken out and cleaned with distilled water and ethanol until neutral. Finally, the product was dried in oven at 60 °C for 4 h, and calcined in air under 250 °C for 4 h with heating rate of 2 °C min−1. Based on the initial molar ratios of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O added (2:4, 3:4 and 4:4), the final samples were labeled as CCO-2:4, CCO, CCO-4:4, respectively. In addition, the reaction equations in hydrothermal and annealing processes for CCO are shown as follows:

The synthetic process is the same with CCO, except for the different oxidizing temperature of 200 °C for CCO-200 and 300 °C for CCO-300, respectively.
The Co3O4 was synthesized on the carbon cloth in the same method with CCO spinel oxide except for without Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and annealed at 250 °C. Likewise, the synthesis process of ZCO and NCO spinel oxides were similar to the CCO spinel oxides annealed at 250 °C, except for replace Cu(NO3)2·3H2O with different metal nitrates of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O with different moles (1, 2, 3 and 4 mmol) for each. For ZCO spinel oxides, the samples were respectively labeled as ZCO-1:4, ZCO-2:4, ZCO, ZCO-4:4, based on the initial molar ratios of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O added (1:4, 2:4, 3:4 and 4:4). For NCO spinel oxides, the samples were respectively labeled as NCO-1:4, NCO-2:4, NCO, NCO-4:4, based on the initial molar ratios of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Co(NO3)2·6H2O added (1:4, 2:4, 3:4 and 4:4).
Crystal phases of as-prepared catalysts were recorded by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffract meter (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA). The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the samples were characterized by a JEOL JSM-7800F with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and element mapping were performed by a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin working at 200 kV. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm at 77.4 K was tested with a NOVA300e 250 volumetric adsorption instrument, and the specific surface area (SBET) and the relevant pore size distribution were calculated based on the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) and density functional theory (DFT) method, respectively. The element content of the synthesized catalysts was quantified by a Thermo Fisher Scientific X series II inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were measured by a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with an A1 Kα line X-ray beam with a diameter of 400 μm. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was conducted at the photoemission end-station (beamline BL10B) in the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in Hefei, China. The XANES spectra were calibrated based on the Au 4f of a freshly sputtered gold wafer.
The CHI 760E electrochemical workstation (Chenhua, Shanghai) was carried out to estimate the electrocatalytic performance in a three-electrode system. In this system, the prepared catalysts cut into 1 cm × 1 cm size, graphite rod and the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively, and 1 M of O2 saturated KOH aqueous solution was utilized as the electrolyte. Potentials were recorded as ERHE directly and the overpotential was obtained according to the formula of ƞ = ERHE − 1.23 V. At the beginning of the measurements, the working electrode were swept circularly from 1.0 to 1.8 V (versus RHE) in the electrolyte to activate the catalyst until a steady voltammogram curve was obtained. The cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded with 5 mV s−1 for capacitive correction. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was conducted with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 to obtain the polarization curves after 90% of iR corrected. The potential was based on iR correction using the equation: E(iR-corrected) = E − 90% iR, where i is the current and R is the uncompensated electrolyte ohmic resistance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test was performed from 10−1 Hz to 105 Hz by applying a sinusoidal amplitude of 5 mV. The inherent catalytic activity can be normalized by the electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA). To estimate the ECSA, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were carried out with various scan rates ranging from 2 to 10 mV s−1 in the non-faradaic potential region. The current densities are determined by j = (ja − jc)/2 at 1.16 V vs scan rate for the catalysts, where ja and jc are the anodic and cathodic current densities normalized by geo, and Cdl values are the slopes of the linear fits. The ECSA can be obtained by RFS, where RF represents the roughness factor and S represents the real surface area of the smooth metal electrode. RF can be calculated by the ratio value of Cdl/Cs, where the Cdl values were obtained from cyclic voltammetry and Cs was 40 µF cm−2 of a smooth surface. S generally equals the geometric area of the carbon electrode. The long-term durability test of the catalysts was carried out by chronoamperometry method.
Density-functional theory (DFT) methods were taken to calculate the structure relaxation and total electronic energy using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with projector-augmented wave pseudopotential (PAW)
[35]
. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) form was adopted in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and a cutoff energy for plane wave basis set is 500 eV

. The ionic convergence limit was set to −0.01 eV Å−1 and the electronic convergence limit was set to 10−5 eV. The van der Waals (vdW) interactions in the systems was described by DFT-D3 scheme of dispersion correction
[38]
. The surface Brillouin zone was sampled by a Monkhorst-Pack grid of size of 5 × 5 × 5. The convergence criteria were further improved so that the changes in energy were <10−5 eV to solve the density of states and charge density self-consistently. The four-electron coupled OER processes are listed below.

The two-step fabrication for AxCo3-xO4 catalysts (A = Co, Ni, Cu or Zn) via co-precipitation and low-temperature oxidation is schematically depicted in
Fig. 1

[39]
, the nanoarrays precursors were successfully grown on carbon cloth (CC) substrate through a facile hydrothermal method. Subsequently, annealed in air at mild temperature, Co3O4, NCO, CCO and ZCO spinel oxides can be successfully achieved. Compared to initial black CC, the color of generated substances on CC changed from purple after hydrothermal synthesis to black after oxidation, indicating successful formation of precursors and apparent transformation of the components (
Fig. S1
). Taking CCO precursor for example, the time-dependent evolution process of controllable morphology during hydrothermal synthesis is carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images to explore the growth mechanism. As shown in
Fig. 1
b–i, the growth evolution consists of orientated self-assembly of hollow core and epitaxial growth of orderly nanowires. In the first 60 min of hydrothermal condition, Cu and Co ions are co-precipitated with urea and form less than 200 nm width of rod-like material. With the structure-directing effect of NH4F, solid nanorods gradually intertwine and knit to form hollow shell with a dense surface (
Fig. 1
b–d). Afterwards, decreased concentration of metal ions in the reaction system can just grow into nanosheets and deposit on the hollow shell surface (
Fig. 1
e). When the metal ion concentration continues to decrease, only short acicular substances form on the nanosheet surface (
Fig. 1
f). Finally, the metal ions react completely and acicular materials gradually epitaxy to form integrated and well-organized nanowire arrays (
Fig. 1
g–i). Therefore, series of AxCo3-xO4 precursors with same 3D waxberry-like nanoarrays can be controllably fabricated in this optimized reaction condition. Meanwhile, the possible chemical reaction equations for hydrothermal and oxidation reaction are listed in the experimental section (Eqs. (1)–(5)).
Fig. 1. (a) Schematic illustration of the fabrication process for AxCo3-xO4 spinel oxides (A = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn). (b–i) SEM images for the growth evolution of CCO precursor at different hydrothermal times and (b1–i1) corresponding magnified images (inset: model diagrams of relevant shape).
To achieve spinel oxides of Co3O4, NCO, CCO and ZCO, the corresponding precursors are oxidized under low-temperature, and SEM images are taken to determine their microstructure characters (
Fig. 2
a–d). Notably, CCO remains same micromorphology with its precursor, suggesting heat treatment just facilitates the phase transformation. NCO, ZCO and Co3O4 exhibit similar orderly nanowire appearance with CCO, indicating this controllable fabrication process for series of Co-based spinel oxides (
Fig. S2
). The analysis of N2 adsorption/desorption curves shows that Co3O4, NCO, CCO and ZCO have similar Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area values, as well as micropore, mesopore and macropore with similar pore diameters observed in pore distribution patterns (
Fig. S3
). The same micromorphology of these catalysts is beneficial to explore catalytic mechanism via theoretical simulation. Moreover, the same microstructures of CCO-200 and CCO-300 with CCO prove that oxidation treatment with lower and higher temperature has no obvious influence on morphology (
Fig. S4
). The phase composition of the obtained samples is analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (
Fig. 2
e). The diffraction peaks of pristine Co3O4 match well with the standard Co3O4 phase (PDF card No. 43-1003), which manifests completely different phase composition with its precursor (
Fig. S5
). After introducing Ni, Cu and Zn elements, the component of NCO, CCO and ZCO coincide well with pure NiCo2O4 phase (PDF card No. 20-0781), Cu0.92Co2.08O4 phase (PDF card No. 37-0878) and NiCo2O4 phase (PDF card No. 23-1390), respectively, possessing cubic spinel structures with Fd-3m space group. Furthermore, the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-MS) results show that the atomic ratios are 1:1.99 for Ni/Co in NCO, 1:2.16 for Cu/Co in CCO and 1:2.03 for Zn/Co in ZCO, closing to the ratios confirmed by XRD results. The XRD measurement of CCO precursor, CCO-200 and CCO-300 are also analyzed to investigate the degree of phase transformation by varied temperatures (
Fig. S6
). Obviously, CCO-300 shows same component with CCO, while CCO-200 still has the same phase composition with the precursor, which means the chosen oxidation temperature for CCO is sufficient. In addition, the internal structure with internally hollow core and externally well-organized nanowires arrays for CCO can be confirmed after scraping the surface (
Fig. 2
f,g and
Fig. S7
). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image further displays the unique nanostructure of nanowires and nanoflakes for CCO (
Fig. 2
h), where the nanoflakes belong to the shell of hollow core. As observed in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of CCO, a single nanowire (
Fig. 2
i) discloses (220) and (111) planes of Cu0.92Co2.08O4 with interplanar spacing value of 0.29 and 0.47 nm. However, the nanoflake exhibits lattice distance of 0.24 and 0.29 nm, which is assigned to (311) and (220) planes of Cu0.92Co2.08O4 (
Fig. 2
j and
Fig. S8
). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns further demonstrate the monocrystalline structure of nanowire and polycrystalline characteristic of nanoflake, where the clear dot matrix and well-defined concentric rings correspond to the crystal planes of Cu0.92Co2.08O4 phase. The element mapping images confirm that Cu, Co and O elements are uniformly distributed on both nanowire and nanoflake of CCO (
Fig. 2
k). The above analysis prove that CCO has a single constitute of spinel Cu0.92Co2.08O4 phase. Besides, the HRTEM images of Co3O4, NCO and ZCO samples also confirm pure phases, since the respective crystal planes correspond to their phase compositions. (
Fig. S9
).

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is carried out to investigate the surface chemical composition and element oxidation states of the obtained samples. All the investigated samples have Co elements, while Ni, Cu and Zn are detected in NCO, CCO and ZCO, respectively, suggesting successful doping of a second transition metal in the corresponding Co-based spinel oxides (
Figs. S10 and S11
). As shown in
Fig. 3
a, the high-resolution XPS Ni 2p spectrum of NCO includes Ni 2p1/2 and Ni 2p3/2 peaks, which can be respectively deconvoluted in to Ni2+ and Ni3+ doublets. In CCO, Cu 2p XPS spectrum with Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2 peaks can be separately fitted into Cu+ and Cu2+ doublets. Zn 2p XPS spectrum of ZCO possesses two main Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2 peaks, ascribed to the divalent Zn ions. As different valence states of the substituted metals could affect the electronic structure of octahedral Co ions, the high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra For Co3O4, NCO, CCO and ZCO are analyzed (
Fig. 3
b). By deconvolution, two spin–orbit doublets (Co3+ and Co2+) of Co cations are shown in both of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks, indicating two definite oxidation states existed. Compared to pristine Co3O4, the Co 2p3/2 peaks of NCO, CCO and ZCO demonstrates negative shift of binding energy, suggesting the average valence-state of Co ions can be increased by the doping of Ni, Cu and Zn elements. It has been proved that in the spinel oxide structure, the high valence state of Co cations at octahedral sites can effectively promote the oxygen evolution process, and the catalytic reaction usually occurs at the superficial active sites
[27]
. Then, the ratio of Co3+ and Co2+ contents of the catalyst surface are calculated to investigate the regulation mechanism of cations substitution and explore the possible influence on OER activity (
Fig. S12
). Apparently, the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ for CCO is 1.81, higher than that for ZCO (1.39), NCO (1.31) and Co3O4 (1.19), which confirms that low valence of Cu cations at tetrahedrons would provide fewer electrons to the O linkage and cause octahedral Co cations emerging higher valence state by losing more electrons. The O 1s XPS spectra of all sample are analyzed, where the peaks of O1 and O2 are generally ascribed to the typical metal–oxygen bond and the absorbed water (
Fig. 3
c). CCO precursor, CCO-200 and CCO-300 samples are also considered to research the effect on different valence state of metal cations by changing the sintering temperature (
Fig. S13
). As can be seen, only small amounts of Co3+ and Cu+ appear in the Co 2p and Cu 2p spectra of CCO-200, and merely Co2+ and Cu2+ existed in that of CCO precursor, implying that lower temperature cannot be enough to form Co-based spinel oxides. The O 1s XPS spectra of CCO-200 and its precursor exhibit the hydroxyl groups of O3 peak, attributed to the phase composition. When the oxidizing temperature increases, the contents of Co3+ and Cu+ increase for CCO and CCO-300, further demonstrating different sintering temperature can adjust the valence states of metallic cations. However, CCO still displays the lowest binding energy of Co 2p3/2 peak and has the highest content ratio of Co3+/Co2+, indicating CCO with high valence state of Co cations can be a promising catalyst for effective electrocatalysis of water oxidation (
Fig. S14
).
Fig. 3. High-resolution XPS spectra fitting curves: (a) Ni 2p of NCO, Cu 2p of CCO and Zn 2p of ZCO. (b) Co 2p and (c) O 1s of different catalysts. XANES spectra: (d) Ni L-edge of NCO, Cu L-edge of CCO, Zn L-edge of ZCO. (e) Co L-edge and (f) O K-edge of different catalysts.
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra are further measured to prove the electronic property and valence state of the samples. As a result of spin–orbit coupling in the 2p state, the L-edge XANES spectra for metallic cations (Ni, Cu and Zn) of NCO, CCO and ZCO display the characteristic L3 (2p3/2 → 3d) and L2 (2p1/2 → 3d) adsorption peaks (
Fig. 3
d). By comparison, the XANES Co L-edge spectra of NCO, CCO and ZCO exhibit higher photon energy of L3 peaks than that of pristine Co3O4, suggesting the reduced electron density of Co atoms and contributing to higher valence state of Co cations by Ni, Cu and Zn doping (
Fig. 3
e)
[40]
. Furthermore, CCO demonstrates the highest Co valence state due to the largest positive shift of L3 peak, which could benefit adsorption and desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates in OER process. The O K-edge XANES spectra of the investigated samples also disclose obvious metal 3d-O 2p and metal 4sp-O 2p hybridized states (
Fig. 3
f)
[41]
. The influence of oxidizing temperature on the valence state of metallic cations is also analyzed based on CCO series (
Fig. S15
). After Cu doping and temperature increasing, CCO still manifests the largest photon energy for L3 peak of Co L-edge XANES spectrum. As reported, the L3 peak of Cu L-edge XANES for CuO possesses lower photon energy than that of Cu2O, revealing the L3 peak of Cu2+ locates at lower energy than the one of Cu+
[42]
. Thus, the Cu L-edge XANES spectrum of CCO show the biggest positive shifted L3 peak, indicating enriched electron density of Cu atom and decreased valence-state of Cu cation. The Co and Cu L-edge XANES spectra of CCO illustrate the increased Co valence state and decreased Cu valence, consistent with the XPS results. Therefore, higher valence state of Co cations in CCO could provide more 3d empty orbits to facilitate electron exchange between Co active sites and oxygen species for OER process, leading to a higher OER performance
[43]
. Overall, introducing Ni, Cu and Zn cations in Co3O4 lattice can regulate the electronic properties of active Co sites. Significantly, when doped with Cu element, the monovalent Cu cations can promote high content of trivalent Co cations and could accelerate the OER efficiency.
The OER electrocatalytic analysis are conducted to evaluate the oxygen catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts. Sintering at same temperature, NCO, CCO and ZCO with the best OER activities are selected by optimized metallic atom ratios during synthetic process (
Fig. S16
). The OER linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves are shown in
Fig. 4
a, NCO, CCO and ZCO demonstrate enhanced OER activity with the smaller overpotential of 276, 207 and 279 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density, much lower than Co3O4 (298 mV) and IrO2 (306 mV), implying increased valence state of Co cations is beneficial to promote catalytic oxygen evolution activity. Moreover, CCO displays excellent activity to reach the largest current density (100 mA cm−2) at the polarization potential of 1.53 V, which outperforms other contrast catalysts of NCO (1.63 V), ZCO (1.59 V), Co3O4 (1.74 V) and IrO2 (1.77 V). The excellent OER activity of CCO is also superior to the commercial IrO2 and most reported non-noble metal based catalysts (

[51]
. Furthermore, when reaching high current density, ZCO exhibits better OER catalytic activity with lower overpotential than that of NCO. The catalytic kinetic is evaluated by Tafel slope. NCO, CCO and ZCO exhibit the Tafel slope of 106, 79 and 84 mV dec−1, respectively, much smaller than that of Co3O4 (123 mV dec−1), suggesting the accelerated catalytic kinetic after metal cations doping (
Fig. 4
c). Besides, the catalytic performance of these samples is also evaluated by ohmic and capacitive corrected CV curves (
Fig. S17
). As well, the corresponding overpotential and Tafel slopes present same tendency in OER activity levels (
Fig. S18
). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) analysis is performed to assess the charge-transfer property. CCO displays smallest semicircle of Nyquist plots among these catalysts, indicating its optimal conductivity and consistent to above kinetics analysis results (
Fig. S19
). In addition, the LSV curves normalized by BET surface area also disclose same activity trend because of same morphology (
Fig. S20
). The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is calculated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests (
Fig. S21
). NCO, CCO, ZCO and Co3O4 possess Cdl values of 103.65, 177.62, 124.55 and 82.65 mF cm−2, respectively (
Fig. 4
d), confirming CCO has more active surface to contact with electrolyte and promote electron exchange during OER since the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) is proportional to Cdl values. The ECSA-normalized polarization curves further verify the best intrinsic OER activity of CCO, and the same trend of catalytic activity indicates the cations regulation is the main factor based on the controllable similar morphology (
Fig. 4
e). The turnover frequency (TOF) values are calculated to determine the intrinsic OER activity. The CV curves are used to determine the number of active centers on the surface of the electrocatalysts (
Fig. S22
). CCO shows the higher TOF values of 0.38 s−1 at 370 mV overpotential, respectively, compared to that of ZCO (0.19 s−1), NCO (0.15 s−1) and Co3O4 (0.028 s−1), indicating its excellent OER performance (
Fig. S23
). In addition, the OER performance of CCO-200 and CCO-300 is considered, which demonstrates the importance of preferred oxidation temperature to promote high content of Co3+, and then contribute to optimal catalytic activity of CCO (
Figs. S24–
26). The above results illustrate the OER performance of pristine Co3O4 can be improved by Ni, Cu and Zn cations doping, in which, Cu substituted ones manifests outstanding catalytic activity because of higher Co valence promoted by low valence state of Cu cations. The durability for OER performance of Co3O4 and CCO is also performed. CCO remains almost unchanged LSV curve after 2000 CV circulations (
Fig. 4
f). After long-term chronoamperometric test, the relative current of CCO declines negligibly of initial, suggesting the excellent stability and durability for OER catalysis (
Fig. 4
g). To evaluate the overall water splitting performance, CCO and the commercial Pt/C are separately employed as anode and cathode in a two-electrode configuration. The CCO//Pt/C electrodes disclose a voltage of 1.52 V and 1.70 V to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm−2 current densities, better than the benchmark of IrO2//Pt/C electrodes (
Fig. 4
h). Under varied current densities, the CCO//Pt/C electrodes show favorable stability (
Fig. 4
i). Meanwhile, the long-time test at both 10 and 100 mA cm−2 proves the excellent durability of CCO//Pt/C electrodes, confirming CCO can be a promising alternative for precious metal-based catalysts (

The morphology and structure of CCO and Co3O4 after OER stability test are also characterized. Both Co3O4 and CCO nearly keep the initial shape without evident corrosion (
Fig. S27
). The HRTEM images of CCO with different areas shown in
Fig. S28
only present the crystal planes of Cu0.92Co2.04O4, and without new amorphization species generation. The XRD patterns of Co3O4 and CCO maintain the original phase composition (
Fig. 4
k), which can be deduced that the considerable OER activity and durability of CCO ascribed to the surface varied valence state. Therefore, the XPS characterization is further taken to determine the variation trend of surface cations on the catalysts after OER test. CCO still exhibits Cu2+ and Cu+ two species in its high-resolution Cu 2p spectrum (
Fig. 4
l). The high resolution Co 2p spectra of Co3O4 and CCO have similar Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks, respectively (
Fig. 4
m and n). However, compared to Co3O4, the Co3+ content in Co 2p spectrum of CCO is much higher than that of Co2+, manifesting that high Co oxidation state is decisive for efficient and steady OER activity. The O 1s spectra of the Co3O4 and CCO consists of typical metal–oxygen bond of O1 and the absorbed water of O2, respectivity (
Fig. 4
o). Meanwhile, the ratio of surface Co3+/Co2+ and Cu2+/Cu+ distribution is shown in
Fig. 4
p. The content ratio of Co3+/Co2+ is 0.70 for Co3O4 and 1.75 for CCO, declined to 58.8% and 96.7% of original specific value respectively, indicating the better durability of CCO than Co3O4 is attributed to more Co3+ content. Furthermore, Cu2+/Cu+ of Cu 2p spectrum for CCO increased a little, demonstrating the actual active site participating in OER process is trivalent Co ions and the Cu cations serve as electronic regulation function to maintain the dynamic balance of charge distribution between dual metals.
Theoretical simulations are carried out to explore the regulation mechanism of OER activity by cations doping based on the same catalyst morphology. Based on literatures, the exposed (110) crystal planes of Co based spinel oxides are usually considered as the OER active surface
[11]
,
[52]
,
[53]
. Therefore, the model structures for Co3O4, NCO, CCO and ZCO are based on the (110) crystal planes of Co3O4, NiCo2O4, CuCo2O4 and ZnCo2O4, respectively (
Fig. 5
a–d). Taking CCO for example, the four electron-coupled OER processes mainly consist of adsorption and desorption of oxygen-containing intermediates (
Fig. 5
e). On the basis of step 2, the mechanism of the high valence of Co cations contributing to OER catalysis is discussed. In this step, the OH– group attacks the *OH and reaction with it under external-voltage, and then the *O, H2O and one electron obtained. For high valanced metal cations, more empty orbitals have not been occupied and can be used to accommodate the obtained electrons, which will be conducted via external circuit. If the empty orbitals are insufficient, the electrons would block the reaction processes, and showed limited electric current or need higher external voltage to force the conduction of electrons from reaction sites rapidly. As shown in
Fig. 5
f, CCO has the lowest theoretical overpotential (0.75 eV) for whole OER processes, followed by ZCO (0.78 eV), NCO (0.84 eV) and pristine Co3O4 (1.14 eV), which presents the same trend with electrochemical data. To further understand the mechanism, the charge deformation of selected structures is calculated to observe the change of electron distribution before and after metal substitution (
Fig. 5
g). Clearly, Co cations (Cooh) at octahedrons of CCO reveal more electrons loss than Co3O4, indicating the Cu substitution is capable to increase the valence state of Cooh. ZCO and NCO also exhibit more electrons lost from Cooh compared to Co3O4 but fewer than that in CCO, suggesting Zn and Ni cations at tetrahedrons contribute more electrons to O anions than Cu cations. The different regulation for Cooh cations could be originated from the diverse valence electron numbers of outer orbits for Co(3d74s2), Ni(3d84s2), Cu(3d104s1) and Zn(3d104s2) elements. Obviously, Cu element possesses specific distribution of valence electrons with fully occupied d orbital and one electron in s orbit, where the only one 4s electron can be easily lost and lead to monovalent copper cation. For Zn, Ni and Co occupied at tetrahedrons, they could lose more electrons than Cu, then adjusting different numbers of electron loss for Cooh. The projected density of states (PDOS) of metals at octahedral and tetrahedral sites are analyzed to further explain the enhanced OER performance (
Fig. S29
). Above the fermi level, the Co-d orbit of Cooh in CCO surface shows the most area for empty orbits than that in ZCO, NCO and pristine Co3O4, contributing to the excellent OER activity of CCO. Therefore, the content of trivalent Co active sites could be improved by Cu, Ni and Zn cations regulation and benefit to catalytic oxygen evolution.

In summary, we fabricate series of spinel oxides nanoarrays on carbon cloth including Co3O4 and Ni, Cu, Zn substituted ones (NCO, CCO and ZCO). The directed self-assembly of hollow core and epitaxial growth of nanowires together with low-temperature oxidation endow these oxides with same microtopography, BET surface area and hierarchical pore structure. On basis of avoiding effect of microstructure difference, the regulated mechanism of Co active sites by metallic cations is revealed by experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations. XPS and XANES analysis results indicate that doped Ni/Cu/Zn cations induce valence state increase of Co cations, where the CCO possesses the highest oxidized state of Co ions. DFT calculations further disclose that Cu has specific valence electrons with just one electron at 4s orbit that can emerge monovalent Cu ions and thereby lead to higher valence state of octahedral Co cations. In alkaline electrolyte, NCO, CCO and ZCO all exhibit markedly enhanced activity compared to Co3O4, while the lowest overpotential of only 207 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density is presented by CCO. This research constructs precise relationship between electronic structure of AxB3-xO4 spinel oxides and related OER activity, and bridging the distance of experiments and theoretical study, thereby offering a guidance for better design of efficient electrocatalysts.

The combination of various phases spontaneously can affect the interfacial electronic structure via re-distributing the charge near the heterojunction interfaces, thus facilitating the charge transfer and interfacial conductivity [22,23]. Meanwhile, constructing a 3D nanoarrays hierarchical structure with interface regulation may increase the amount of accessible active sites, accelerate the electrolyte penetration and promote the release of gas bubbles. [24,25]. Additionally, the elaborately designed heterojunction will integrate the intrinsic advantages of each component and generate synergistic effects.
In this regard, various studies have developed valence engineering of transition metal in S-TMCs as an effective way to improve OER performance.[30,36,43] Moreover, it has been reported that valency of transition metal can be modulated to higher valence states in S-TMCs by rationally doping heteroatoms into spinel structures.[43,44] Therefore, it would be still worthwhile to develop the valence engineered S-TMCs with high valence states and consider the role of highly oxidized metal species in OER catalytic activities through heteroatom doping strategies.
