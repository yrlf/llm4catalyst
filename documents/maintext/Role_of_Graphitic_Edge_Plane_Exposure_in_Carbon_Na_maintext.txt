1 Introduction
Carbon-based oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts used as alternates to Pt in PEM and direct methanol fuel cells have been an active field of research for many years. Early work started with using Fe- and Co-centered macrocycles supported on carbon. (1, 2) To improve stability without diminishing activity, pyrolyzed macrocycles were developed thereafter. (3-5) It was later found that combining a metal (usually Fe or Co), a carbon source, and a nitrogen source at high temperature resulted in equally active and stable ORR catalysts. (6) Much of the work in the past 15 years has been on these nonmacrocycle carbon-based materials. (7-13) Recent reports have shown improved ORR activity for this class of materials that begin to make them more viable. (12) Even with this level of research activity, the materials studied are still not well understood in terms of why they are active for ORR. The role that iron plays in the ORR activity of these catalysts is being heavily debated in the literature with some arguing that Fe−N centers are the active sites (7, 12-14) and others that Fe is not part of the active site. (8, 10, 15, 16) From work in our research group (17-19) and others, (8) carbon nanostructure has been proposed to have a role in carbon-based ORR catalyst performance also. We have previously reported that nitrogen-containing carbon catalysts with higher graphitic edge plane exposure, such as stacked cups compared to nanotubes, have higher ORR activity. (17-19)
Graphitic plane orientation and edge plane exposure of nanostructures can be controlled by altering the nanofiber growth conditions. (20-22) Changes to the growth temperature, medium, and fiber growth catalyst can significantly alter the resulting carbon nanostructures produced. (20) Stacked platelets, stacked cups, and herringbone nanofibers are commonly used when high edge plane exposure is desired. (23-26) Nanotubes are commonly the nanofiber of choice when minimal edge plane exposure is desired. (24, 27)
The intent of this publication is to study the role of carbon nanostructure in ORR carbon-based catalysts by comparing nanofibers with high graphitic edge plane exposure to nanofibers with very little edge plane exposure as model structures. These nanofibers have been grown and treated to incorporate nitrogen into the nanostructure. The objective of this study is not to develop high-performance catalyst materials, but rather probe the role of nanostructure using these model systems.
2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials Preparation
2.1.1 Preparation of Stacked Platelet Nanofibers
Stacked platelet nanofibers were used as the nanostructures with high edge plane exposure. To prepare the stacked platelet nanofibers, a procedure following the outline of a patent by Rodriguez and Baker was used. (28) An unsupported 95:5 atomic ratio iron:copper (Fe:Cu) nanofiber growth catalyst was prepared using a coprecipitation method for the creation of stacked platelet nanofibers. In this method, the respective nitrate salts (Sigma-Aldrich) were made into 1 M aqueous solutions and combined to form the 95:5 Fe:Cu ratio. A small amount of ammonium carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (0.5 M) was added to a beaker, and the nitrate solution was slowly added while stirring with a magnetic stir bar. More ammonium carbonate was added during the nitrate addition process to maintain a pH between 8.1 and 8.4. After all of the nitrate solution was added, the coprecipitation catalyst was vacuum filtered with excess DI water and allowed to dry at 110 °C in air. The dried 95:5 Fe:Cu catalyst was calcined at 350 °C for 2 h while exposed to air.
To grow the stacked platelets, 200 mg of the calcined 95:5 Fe:Cu catalyst was loaded into a quartz sample boat. The unsupported metal catalyst was reduced in 10% H2 in He at 600 °C for 12 h before stacked platelet growth. Immediately following the reduction step without cooling, the sample was purged with He to remove any hydrogen from the system. Stacked platelets were grown over the reduced catalyst after the purge using a 4:1 CO:H2 reactant stream with a balance of He. This was performed at 600 °C for 2 h before being cooled under He.
The resulting stacked platelet nanofibers were washed with 1 M HCl (Fisher Scientific) at 60 °C to remove any exposed copper or iron. After washing, the nanofibers were vacuum filtered with 1 L of excess DI water before being dried at 110 °C in air.
2.1.2 Preparation of Nanofibers with Basal Plane Exposure
As a comparison to the stacked platelet nanofibers, nanofibers with low graphitic edge plane exposure, or high basal plane exposure, were prepared. The preparation of the nanofibers with basal plane exposure followed the same outline as the stacked platelet nanofibers. For the nanofibers with basal plane exposure, a 6:4 Fe:Cu nanofiber growth catalyst was prepared and calcined. To grow the nanofibers with basal plane exposure, 100 mg of 6:4 Fe:Cu catalyst was reduced in hydrogen before nanofiber growth in 4:1 CO:H2, balance He stream at 675 °C for 2 h. After cooling in He, the nanofibers with basal plane exposure were also washed in HCl as described in section .
2.1.3 Acid Oxidation of the Nanofibers
Nanofibers were oxidized to add oxygen functional groups to the carbon surface prior to ammonia treatment. A concentrated solution of 1:1 by volume HNO3 (69 mass %) (Fisher Scientific):H2SO4 (97 mass %) (Fisher Scientific) was prepared as the oxidation medium. Nanofibers were suspended in the concentrated acid solution at 60 °C under constant stirring using a magnetic stir bar for 3 h, before allowing to cool 1 h. The nanofiber−acid suspension was slowly added to excess DI water for dilution before vacuum filtering the nanofibers with additional excess DI water. The collected nanofibers were dried in air at 110 °C.
2.1.4 Ammonia Treatment of the Nanofibers
Ammonia was used to introduce nitrogen into the nanofibers after acid oxidation. Nanofibers were placed in a quartz sample boat and purged with He. After purging, 72% NH3 in He was introduced into the reactor, and the furnace was ramped at 10 °C/min to 600 or 900 °C. Ammonia treatment durations were 4 h at 600 or 900 °C and 19.5 h at 900 °C, before cooling in He for the stacked platelets. The acid-oxidized nanofibers with basal plane exposure were treated at 900 °C for 19.5 h in ammonia for comparison.
2.2 Materials Characterization
2.2.1 Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was used to examine the carbon nanostructures. An FEI Tecnai F20 XT TEM was used in brightfield mode at 200 keV. Samples were prepared for analysis by suspending in ethanol and dispersing on a lacey Formvar carbon supported on a 200 mesh copper TEM grid.
2.2.2 Hydrophobicity Imaging
Water droplets were monitored on the surface of nanofiber pellets using a high-speed camera to examine the hydrophobic nature of the nanofibers produced. For the imaging, the nanofibers after being HCl washed and dried were pelletized into disks without any diluents. A single droplet generator was used to deposit drops on the surface of the nanofibers with an average size of 539 μm in diameter. The droplet behavior on the nanofiber surface was monitored using an Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope with an Olympus DF1XPF lens and recorded at 200 frames/s with an EPIX Silicon Video 642M camera.
2.2.3 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the surface composition of the nanofibers. Samples were pelletized into stainless steel cups for analysis. A Kratos Ultra Axis spectrometer was used with a monochromated aluminum anode source. In addition to a survey scan, the Fe 2p, O 1s, N 1s, C 1s, and S 2p regions were scanned. Sensitivity factors reported for the anode type and position by the manufacturer were used in determination of the species contents on the surface.
2.2.4 Temperature-Programmed Oxidation Experiments
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were performed to study the oxidation temperature of the carbon as well as identify the bulk species in the nanofibers. To run the TPO experiments, ∼25 mg of nanofibers was loaded into a quartz reactor. The temperature was ramped from 5 °C/min to 900 °C under 10% O2/He flow. The TPO product stream was connected to a MKS Cirrus residual gas analyzer. Mass signals 1−100 were monitored during the experiments.
2.3 Activity and Selectivity Testing
Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) experiments were used to determine the ORR activity and selectivity of the nanofibers studied. Complete details of the RRDE testing procedure and experimental setup have been reported previously. (29) Briefly, the catalyst was applied to the glassy carbon disk electrode using an ink with a composition by mass of 1:10:160 catalyst:5% Nafion in aliphatic alcohols:ethanol. The catalyst loading on the disk was 426 μg/cm2. Cyclic voltammograms at 10 mV/s from 1.2 to 0.0 V to 1.2 V vs NHE were used to determine the ORR activity of the catalysts. A platinum ring held at 1.2 V vs NHE during activity testing was used to monitor the H2O2 production of the prepared nanofibers.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Physical Characterization
The successful preparation and treatment of well-controlled carbon nanostructure types is not trivial and must be discussed before any conclusions can be made about their use as model catalyst systems in ORR.
Small changes in Fe:Cu ratio and nanofiber growth temperature can change the carbon nanostructure produced significantly. TEM analysis of the nanofibers produced was performed to verify that stacked platelets with high edge plane exposure were prepared. Figure 1 shows examples of the nanofibers prepared using 95:5 Fe:Cu catalyst at a 600 °C growth temperature after HCl washing. Nanofiber diameters varied from 50 to 300 nm, with the nanofiber shown in Figure 1a exhibiting a typical diameter. Most important for this study are the orientation and exposure of the graphitic edge planes. Under these preparation conditions, graphitic sheets were positioned perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the nanofiber, allowing for large degrees of graphitic edge plane exposure and minimal basal plane exposure, as illustrated in the inset to Figure 1a. Figure 1b shows the graphitic edge plane exposure for these stacked platelets at a higher magnification. The perpendicular orientation of the graphitic sheets verified that stacked platelet nanofibers were produced. Additionally, all nanofibers studied with TEM using the 95:5 Fe:Cu catalyst had similar shape and perpendicular graphitic edge plane exposure.

In contrast, carbon deposition over 6:4 Fe:Cu at 675 °C produced a variety of nanofibers, as shown in Figure 2. Two main types of nanofibers were observed: large helical nanofibers (Figure 2a,b) and smaller hollow tubes (Figure 2c). The helical-type nanofibers had diameters of 200−500 nm, while the hollow tubes had diameters of 30−100 nm. Interestingly, high-resolution analysis of both types of nanofibers produced from the 6:4 Fe:Cu growth catalyst showed long graphitic sheets parallel to the longitudinal axis even though at lower magnification the nanofibers appeared very different (insets to Figure 2a−c). The tubular nanofibers were verified to have low levels of edge plane exposure and high levels of graphitic basal plane exposure. The 2-D images taken from TEM cannot definitively distinguish between parallel basal planes and parallel edge planes, though it was hypothesized that both types of nanofibers from the 6:4 Fe:Cu growth catalyst had high basal plane exposure.

To further verify the differences between the stacked platelets and the nanofibers grown with the 6:4 Fe:Cu catalyst at 675 °C, hydrophobicity imaging was performed. Nanofibers with more edge plane exposure are expected to be more hydrophilic than nanofibers with more basal plane exposure. The water droplets quickly disappeared on the surface of the stacked platelets, lasting an average of 0.135 ± 0.005 s. The water droplets on the nanofibers grown from 6:4 Fe:Cu lasted much longer (an average of 0.47 ± 0.13 s). As a comparison, Figure 3 shows water droplets on the stacked platelets (a) and nanofibers grown over the 6:4 Fe:Cu catalysts (b), which could now be termed “nanofibers with basal plane exposure”. These images are shown at the same time period after the water droplet was placed on the nanofiber surface. The droplet on the stacked platelet nanofibers has a contact angle much more obtuse to the surface than the nanofibers with basal plane, also indicating a difference in hydrophobicity. In addition, the water droplet itself was also absorbed into the stacked platelet pellet more at the same time period. These observations show that the stacked platelet nanofibers are much more hydrophilic than the nanofibers with basal planes. The combination of the hydrophobicity imaging with TEM imaging allowed for a more definitive conclusion to be made about the two different degrees of edge plane exposure for the nanofiber types being studied.

After the observation that the nanofibers grown from 6:4 Fe:Cu at 675 °C had less edge plane exposure than the stacked platelet nanofibers, these nanofibers were deemed acceptable as a comparison structure to the stacked platelet nanofibers with high edge plane exposure. These nanofibers with basal plane exposure were preferred to a commercial multiwalled nanotube (MWNT) because the physical dimensions of the nanofibers with basal plane exposure were more similar to the stacked platelets than the very small diameter MWNTs.
It is known that the incorporation of nitrogen into graphitic materials can be difficult. (30) To aid in the nitrogen incorporation, mild oxidation of the carbon can be performed. In concentrated acid oxidations, such as the HNO3 and H2SO4 used in this study, defects are created in the graphitic structure providing sites for oxygen functional groups to attach. (31) A constant temperature treatment at 60 °C was selected as opposed to refluxing. A nanofiber with basal plane exposure that has a high concentration of surface defects would result in losing the objective of the study to examine the role of graphitic edge plane exposure.
Significant differences in the carbon nanostructure were not observed with oxidation treatment using TEM analysis (images not shown), also verifying that the oxidation procedure was rather mild.
Ammonia treatments at elevated temperatures are known to incorporate nitrogen into carbon matrices. (22, 30, 32-34) With increased graphitization of the carbon, nitrogen incorporation becomes more difficult; (34) hence, the need to create sites for ammonia attack through oxidation arises. Ammonia is proposed to introduce nitrogen into carbon through a corrosion process where ammonia directly reacts with the carbon to form HCN and H2 (34) or exchanges with the oxygen functional groups on the carbon surface, ultimately incorporating nitrogen into the carbon. (32) In this study, after a 4 h ammonia treatment at 600 °C, little mass was lost (19%) from the stacked platelets, as listed in Table 1 of mass losses with ammonia treatment. A 4 h treatment duration at 900 °C in ammonia also saw minimal mass loss. Interestingly, after 19.5 h at 900 °C in an ammonia-rich stream, a significant percentage of the mass (76%) was lost from the starting acid-oxidized stacked platelets. This suggests that not only temperature but also duration is important for significant ammonia corrosion on the carbon to occur. The oxidation pretreatment was also found to increase the ammonia corrosion. As a comparison, an ammonia treatment on unoxidized stacked platelets for 19.5 h at 900 °C led to a 42% mass loss only. For the oxidized nanofibers with basal plane exposure treated at 900 °C for 19.5 h in ammonia, a mass loss of 47% was also observed, suggesting that ammonia was able to successfully corrode carbon and incorporate nitrogen into the nanofibers. However, further analysis was required using XPS and temperature-programmed oxidation experiments to verify nitrogen incorporation.
Table 1. Mass Loss during Ammonia Treatment

stacked platelets−HCl−HNO3:H2SO4−900 °C NH3 (4 h) 7

stacked platelets−HCl−900 °C NH3 (19.5 h) 42
nanofibers with basal plane exposure−HCl−HNO3:H2SO4−900 °C NH3 (19.5 h) 47
The significant mass loss during ammonia treatment at 900 °C for extended time would suggest that the carbon nanofiber structures may be attacked or altered. TEM analysis did not reveal significant changes in the carbon nanostructure as indicated by examining the graphitic planes of Figure 4.

3.2 Chemical Characterization
3.2.1 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Beyond the physical structure of the nanofibers used in this study, it is important to know the chemical composition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the types of surface species on the nanofibers. Table 2 shows surface species content for stacked platelets. As expected, the stacked platelet surface was largely composed of graphitic carbon.

XPS analysis showed no detectable surface nitrogen in the stacked platelets prior to acid oxidation and ammonia treatments. Figure 5 shows that after acid oxidation and ammonia treatments nitrogen was present in the stacked platelets. Depending upon the treatment, the nitrogen species and content differed. After acid oxidation treatment on the stacked platelets, 1.6 atomic % nitrogen was observed on the surface of the nanofiber. This nitrogen is residual from the HNO3 used in the oxidation treatment. An assignment of N−O species (35) is consistent with this assumption. The stacked platelets with the highest nitrogen content were the ones treated at 600 °C in ammonia. The nitrogen spectra broadened to shift to lower binding energies with this lower temperature ammonia treatment. With increased ammonia treatment temperature and duration, the nitrogen surface content decreased and the species appeared more prevalent at lower binding energies. It is likely that after 600 °C treatment there was a mix of nitrogen bonded to the surface oxygen and nitrogen beginning to be incorporated into the graphitic lattice. At higher temperatures, the oxygen functional groups are being removed, and at the locations where the oxygen was once attached, nitrogen is being substituted by incorporating into the carbon. It is likely that this process occurs at the graphite edges first. This “edge nitrogen” could be assigned to three species that can be observed in the N 1s spectra: pyridinic-N (398.0−398.9 eV (33, 36)), pyrrolic-N (400.0−400.3 eV (36, 37)), and quarternary-N (401.0−402.0 eV (36, 37)). While the pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N always have nitrogen located on the graphitic edge, quarternary-N can be both “edge-N” and “bulk-like-N”. The edge-N quarternary assignment will have one interior carbon and two edge carbons bond to it. Shifts to lower N 1s binding energies as the ammonia treatment increased to 900 °C suggests that more edge-N is present. The N 1s assignments become less certain as the nitrogen concentrations become closer to the detection limit, even with increased scans to reduce the S/N of the spectra (as was the case with both the stacked platelet samples treated at 900 °C in ammonia). As the binding energy position shifts higher, other species may be contributing to what has been fitted for the spectra (as may be the case for the stacked platelets treated with ammonia at 600 °C where nitrogen−oxygen species and nitrogen externally bound to the carbon may also be involved). Oxygen content also follows the discussion of the nitrogen content for stacked platelets. A large amount (15.4%) of surface oxygen is present immediately following acid oxidation of the stacked platelets. The quantity of surface oxygen diminishes significantly with ammonia treatment. There is a possibility that nitrogen is exchanging with surface oxygen (as evidenced by the increase at 600 °C in nitrogen content). Nitrogen species may also be desorbing from the carbon surface with temperature as well.

As seen from Figure 6, there was a wide distribution of oxygen species present on the stacked platelets. O 1s oxygen functional group assignments include physically adsorbed oxygen (530.1 eV), (38) quinones and carbonyls (531.0 eV), (35, 39) sulfur−oxygen functional groups (531.6 eV), (40) C═O in anhydrides or lactones and ethers (532.3 eV), (35, 39) ether oxygens in lactones or anhydrides (533.3 eV), (35, 39) and oxygen atoms in carboxyl groups (534.2 eV). (35, 39) While there was not a clear trend in between treatment used and the nature of the functional groups formed, a few interesting observations were made beyond total oxygen content. The lower binding energy species appeared to be most resilient to ammonia attack or formed most readily when exposed to the atmosphere after treatment. Large quantities of quinone or carbonyl groups were added with acid oxidation and removed or masked any physisorbed oxygen found on the stacked platelets.

If ammonia was incorporating nitrogen into the carbon matrix through an oxygen functional group pathway, the loss of oxygen species with ammonia treatment would be expected. It has been proposed in the literature that ammonia exchanges with C═O oxygen functionalities on carbon nanostructures to incorporate nitrogen into the carbon. (32) Most of the functionalities that can be identified by XPS have a C═O feature that could participate in the nitrogen exchange with ammonia. This would also explain why the small amount of carboxylic species disappears with ammonia treatments, as did the lactone and anhydride assignment for the stacked platelets after extended duration ammonia treatment at 900 °C. The acid-oxidized stacked platelets had a large quantity of carbonyl and quinone-type groups identified, that again, decreased with ammonia treatment. Some of these most likely desorbed from the surface with simple heating, but a portion may have been subject to ammonia attack.
Comparing the surface composition of the nanofibers with basal plane exposure to the stacked platelets, overall there were fewer surface species present on the nanofibers with basal plane exposure after each treatment, as seen in Table 3. Acid oxidation of the nanofibers with basal plane exposure was effective in adding oxygen surface functionalities, however, to a lesser degree than the treatment of stacked platelets. The absence of graphitic edges for the oxygen functional groups to readily adhere to is likely to be the reason behind the reduced amount of surface oxygen after acid oxidation on the nanofibers with basal plane exposure. It has been reported that, during oxygen functionalization of nanotubes, defects in the basal planes are created for the oxygen functional groups to adhere to. (31) In this study, creation of more defects was not desirable since it would make the nanofibers with basal plane exposure become more and more like the high-edge-exposure stacked platelets. Some of the oxygen was required, however, to be able to incorporate nitrogen into the nanofibers with basal plane exposure through the oxygen exchange process with ammonia treatment.

There were several observations that could be made by comparing the oxygen species on the nanofibers with basal plane exposure to the stacked platelets, as seen in Figure 7. The untreated nanofibers with basal plane exposure had less physisorbed oxygen than the stacked platelets. This may be due to the lack of edge planes for the oxygen to adhere to. With acid oxidation, the largest component was again quinones and carbonyls, similar to the spectra taken over stacked platelets. After ammonia treatment at 900 °C for 19.5 h, the nanofibers with basal plane exposure had very little oxygen left. A large component was physisorbed oxygen, which is likely due to exposure to the atmosphere after treatment. It is possible that most of the reactive oxygen was exchanged during ammonia treatment. Another explanation for the reduced amount of nonphysisorbed oxygen species on the surface of the nanofibers with basal plane exposure compared to the stacked platelets is that oxygen functional groups are likely not as well adhered to the carbon surface on the basal planes. This would allow for more of the oxygen functional groups to desorb from the surface of the carbon with heating.

After ammonia treatment of the acid-oxidized nanofibers with basal plane exposure, only a trace amount of nitrogen was observed in XPS and could not be quantified. Oxygen groups were largely evolved off after ammonia treatment as well. Although there was no significant nitrogen incorporation, the mass losses reported above for these nanofibers still suggest that ammonia corrosion was occurring.
3.2.2 Temperature-Programmed Oxidation Experiments
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments were performed to further study the composition of the nanofibers and the stability of the carbon. The temperature at which carbon oxidizes can be indicative of the type of carbon, degree of graphitization, and edge plane exposure.
The TPO profiles for stacked platelets after various treatments are presented in Figure 8. The mass signals for 44 (CO2), 30 (NOx), and 64 (SO2) are shown. As seen from the figure, a shift in the carbon oxidation to higher temperatures with treatment is observed, suggesting a change in the oxidation resistance. As treatment severity increases on the stacked platelets from simple HCl wash to high-temperature ammonia treatments, the easily oxidizable carbon continues to be removed, thereby shifting the observed oxidation onset temperature from 430 to 515 °C. For the acid-oxidized stacked platelets, early evolution of nitrogen and sulfur groups is observed prior to the carbon oxidation. This suggests that much of the nitrogen and sulfur groups were attached to the surface of the stacked platelets rather than incorporated into the graphitic matrix, which was also observed in XPS. The XPS S 2p spectra inset to Figure 8 next to the acid oxidized stacked platelets profile verifies the nature of sulfur as surface sulfate species (S 2p1/2 assignment of 163.8 eV (35, 41)). However, there were small amounts of nitrogen and sulfur that evolved during the carbon oxidation period, suggesting that a small amount of the nitrogen and sulfur was incorporated into the graphitic matrix with acid oxidation treatment, even though they were below XPS detection limits.

Inset: S 2p region of the X-ray photoelectron spectra for stacked platelets−HCl−HNO3:H2SO4.
After ammonia treatments, the low-temperature surface species evolution during TPO was not observed. Larger quantities of nitrogen were observed to evolve with the carbon oxidation, verifying the observation from XPS of a shift to more maxtrix-incorporated nitrogen with ammonia treatment rather than surface-attached nitrogen. The shift with increased ammonia temperature to higher evolution temperature for the nitrogen species also suggests that the nitrogen was more strongly bound to the graphitic matrix after 900 °C treatment. A small amount of sulfur left in the graphite appeared to stay in the carbon matrix even after ammonia treatment, though in lesser quantities with increased ammonia treatment severity. With ammonia treatment, sulfur species were no longer detectable in XPS, suggesting the surface sulfur species were also part of an oxygen functional group either exchanged with nitrogen or desorbed from the graphitic surface with treatment.
TPO experiments performed on the nanofibers with basal planes revealed similar trends with treatment compared to the stacked platelet TPO experiments, as seen in Figure 9. The nanofibers with basal plane exposure had a much broader carbon oxidation envelope. This broader envelope may be due to the heterogeneity of the nanofibers with basal plane exposure, with its two types of nanogeometries. Once again, surface nitrogen and sulfur species were observed evolving from the nanofibers at low temperatures after acid oxidation treatments, supporting the XPS findings that nitrogen and sulfur are on the surface rather than incorporated into the graphitic nanostructure. The TPO experiments were able to verify that nitrogen was present in the carbon nanostructure. This finding shows that ammonia treatment was successful in incorporating nitrogen into the graphitic nanostructure, even though the nitrogen content was below quantifiable levels from XPS.

3.3 Activity and Selectivity Testing
The characterization results discussed above show that nanofibers with low- and high-graphitic edge plane exposure were successfully made and post-treated to incorporate nitrogen. While nitrogen levels were low compared to nitrogen-containing carbon nanostructures (CNx) studied as ORR catalysts in our research group previously, (17-19, 29) they were deemed high enough to investigate further for ORR activity.
Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) tests were performed on the nanofibers after each treatment process to study the role of nanostructure and composition on ORR activity and selectivity. The results obtained for the stacked platelets are shown in Figure 10. Untreated stacked platelets showed minimal oxygen reduction activity, with an onset of activity at 0.444 V vs NHE. Both acid oxidation and ammonia treatment at 600 °C on the stacked platelets showed minimal ORR activity as well. Increasing the ammonia treatment temperature on the stacked platelets to 900 °C began to produce a material with some ORR activity. By increasing the ammonia treatment duration at 900 °C, the activity was improved by another 300 mV shift toward better ORR activity compared to the untreated stacked platelets. The additional ammonia treatment duration also saw a significant increase in current density. Selectivity results were shown to trend with ORR activity as illustrated in Figure 10b. The untreated stacked platelets had poor selectivity to water formation, while the stacked platelets treated at 900 °C for 19.5 h in ammonia had a selectivity approaching 3.9 electrons transferred per oxygen molecule, equivalent to 95% selectivity to water formation.

In comparison to the stacked platelets, the nanofibers with basal plane exposure had significantly less activity under the same treatment conditions. Untreated nanofibers with basal plane exposure had even less ORR activity than untreated stacked platelets. Prolonged ammonia treatment at 900 °C on nanofibers with basal plane exposure increased the ORR onset of activity, but only by 150 mV to a 0.565 V vs NHE onset of activity.
While none of the materials studied would be considered good ORR catalysts, there is enough activity to use them as model systems to discuss the role that nanostructure and composition play in ORR activity.
High nitrogen contents in carbon-based catalysts are frequently cited as a significant contributor to ORR activity. Observations with the acid-oxidized stacked platelets and the 600 °C ammonia-treated stacked platelets showed that gross nitrogen content does not dictate ORR performance. The location of the nitrogen plays an important role in the ORR activity. As the nitrogen species became more incorporated into the graphitic matrix, possibly in the form of edge-type nitrogen, the ORR activity increased, even though the overall surface nitrogen content dropped by almost a factor of 7 when comparing the stacked platelets treated in ammonia at 900 °C to those treated at 600 °C. Previous studies in our research group have seen ORR activity trends with pyridinic-N content. (17-19) From those studies, it was unclear if the pyridinic-N was directly impacting ORR activity or if it was merely acting as a marker for edge plane exposure, as it is located on the edge plane and the most active catalysts had both the highest graphitic edge plane exposure content and highest pyridinic-N content. (17-19) Since the same starting stacked platelet nanofibers were used before and after ammonia treatment for this study, the role that edge-N and edge plane exposure can be better distinguished. These results suggest that edge-N content plays a much stronger role than edge plane exposure. Rather, edge plane exposure provides the appropriate geometry for nitrogen incorporation, leading to an active site. Nanofibers with basal plane exposure, on the other hand, did not possess the right geometry for the formation of ORR active sites.
It should also be noted that the observation about edge-N does not necessarily contradict researchers who have hypothesized that quarternary-N species are the active nitrogen groups, (10, 42) as the quarternary species observed could also be edge-N.
In addition to nanostructure and nitrogen, a few observations about oxygen content may also be made from this study. High oxygen contents on the nanofibers did not substantially improve the ORR activity without the presence of nitrogen incorporated into the nanostructure. A small improvement in ORR activity was observed with increased oxygen content on the nanofibers with basal plane exposure. It is possible that this improvement was due to the increase in graphitic defects created during the acid oxidation process, as current density began to approach that of the acid-oxidized stacked platelets.
4 Conclusions
Stacked platelet nanofibers and nanofibers with basal plane exposure were successfully grown and characterized after various treatments with acids and/or ammonia. The stacked platelets, with high graphitic edge plane exposure, and nanofibers with basal plane exposure and minimal edge plane exposure were studied before and after ammonia treatment to probe the role that nanostructure plays in ORR activity. While neither type of nanofiber had large quantities of nitrogen or was highly active for ORR, they were considered useful model systems. It was found that edge plane exposure alone does not promote ORR activity. Rather, carbon nanostructures with high edge plane exposure provide the appropriate locations for nitrogen to incorporate into the graphitic matrix. The presence of oxygen functionalities alone were also not sufficient to have a significant impact on ORR activity.
