Introduction
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) offers a promising strategy to address severe global warming and energy shortage issues by converting greenhouse gas into fuels or value-added chemicals.1 For various heterogeneous CRR processes, C1 products (CO2+2 H++2 e−→CO+H2O, −0.11 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) or CO2+2 H++2 e−→HCOOH, −0.19 V vs. RHE) exhibit relatively larger current densities and higher selectivities compared to other CO2 reduction products.2 To date, single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed active metal species on support are the most effective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO in aqueous solution.3 SACs show outstanding catalytic performance and excellent selectivity by utilizing the maximum atom efficiency and tuning the well-defined metal active centers with unique electronic properties.4 The state-of-the-art Ni SACs are promising for CRR.5 Unfortunately, most of the SACs are powder-based and suffer from a low density of active sites, and the integrated SAC electrodes show poor electrical conduction and slow mass transport, which limit the electrochemical applications.6
Self-standing nanoarrays with catalytically active components directly grown on a three-dimensional (3D) substrate have shown great potential for electrocatalysis due to their unique porous structure with high density of accessible active sites, improved mass transport, and enhanced charge conduction.7 Herein, we combine the advantages of SAC and self-standing nanoarrays and develop a single-atom electrode consisting of isolated, high-density, and low-valent nickel(I) sites anchored on a self-standing bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotube array with nickel–copper alloy encapsulation (NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu) on a microporous carbon-fiber paper (CFP) for CRR. The single-atom electrode combines atomically isolated low-valent NiI species as active sites for CO2-to-CO reduction, and large specific surface area from the carbon nanotube (CNT) array for sufficient active sites exposure. The direct growth of CNT array on CFP ensures a tight binding to substrate for maximizing the charge conduction and at the same time an aerophobic surface for accelerating product release. Additionally, the introduction of copper into nickel to form a copper–nickel alloy further enhances the adsorption of hydrogen by tailoring the d-band center of inescapable metallic nanoparticles (NPs), which suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Therefore, the NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu nanoarray electrode exhibits a 97 % Faradic efficiency toward CO formation in 0.5 m KHCO3 aqueous solution, with a current density of −32.87 mA cm−2 and turnover frequency (TOF) of 1962 h−1 at an overpotential of 620 mV.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 a and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information show the synthetic procedures to prepare the NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu nanoarray on CFP. Ni–Cu layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheet array with Ni/Cu=9 was first synthesized on CFP by a solvothermal method. Subsequently, the Ni-NCNT@Ni9Cu nanoarray was grown on CFP using an LDH nanosheet array as the pre-catalyst and melamine as both the carbon and nitrogen source at 650 °C under inert atmosphere. The carbon encapsulated Ni9Cu alloy NPs were located at the tip area of CNTs, and atomically dispersed nickel(I) species were anchored in CNTs as Ni-N4 sites through strong metal–nitrogen coordination interactions. The Ni9Cu alloy NPs are well encapsulated by multiple carbon layers and are not easily removable from Ni-NCNT@Ni9Cu without damaging the structure of the latter. The catalyst was leached in dilute acid to remove exposed metal NPs and unstable species, finally producing the NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu nanoarray. Meanwhile, NiI-NCNT@NiCu and NiI-NCNT@Ni nanoarrays were synthesized in a similar way by only changing the metal ratio in LDH for comparison. The morphology of the obtained catalysts was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Unlike the very smooth surface of CFP and the rough surface of vertically aligned LDH nanosheet array (Figure S2), the as-prepared catalyst surface was densely covered with twisting CNTs (Figure 1 b). TEM measurements (Figure 1 c,d) reveal bamboo-like hollow multiwalled carbon nanotubes with an average diameter of 27 nm. Ni9Cu alloy NPs tightly encapsulated in the multilayered carbon shells (lattice spacing=0.338 nm) were observed at the tip of the nanotubes (Figure 1 c), showing that the bamboo-like CNTs grow through a vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) mechanism.8 The lattice spacing of Ni9Cu alloy NPs was measured to be 0.208 nm, which is slightly larger than that for Ni NPs in NiI-NCNT@Ni (0.204 nm, Figure S3), indicating formation of nickel–copper alloy. No metal clusters were observed on the CNTs. Moreover, the average length of CNTs showed a positive relation with the Ni content in nickel–copper LDH. NiI-NCNT@Ni has a similar morphology with NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu, but NiI-NCNT@NiCu tubes with less Ni are thicker and shorter (Figure S3). Elemental mappings in scanning transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) demonstrate distribution of N, Ni, and Cu species across the tubular structure (Figure 1 e and Figure S4). In the Ni mapping image (marked by green dots), in addition to the alloyed NPs region with concentrated signals, Ni signals were also uniformly detected on N-doped CNTs, suggesting successful incorporation of Ni atoms in N-doped CNTs. In addition, STEM-EDS line scan (Figure S5) and STEM-electron energy loss spectroscopy (STEM-EELS) mapping (Figure S6) show that the content of single Cu atoms is much lower than that of single Ni atoms. Thus, the effect of Cu single atoms on CRR activity could be ignored. The atomic dispersion of Ni sites on CNTs was confirmed by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). As shown in Figure 1 f, bright dots corresponding to Ni single atom sites (size of the bright spots is ca. 0.2 nm) are homogenously distributed throughout the entire N-doped CNT. Figure 1 g and Figure S7 a compare the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the substrate, precursors, and catalysts with different metal ratios before and after acid leaching. Besides the strong (002) and (004) carbon diffraction peaks at 26.4° and 54.5° (JCPDS, 75-1621) from CNT arrays and carbon fiber paper substrate, diffraction peaks belonging to Ni are detected for Ni-NCNT@Ni9Cu at approximately 44.5°, corresponding well to the (111) plane of Ni0 (JCPDS, 71-4655) (Figure S7 a). The intensity of metallic diffraction peaks decreases after acid leaching, indicating removal of exposed metal NPs (Figure 1 g and Figure S7 a).

JCPDS profiles refer to graphite (75-1621) and metallic nickel (71-4655).
The oxidation states of metal atoms were examined from the position of the rising edge of the Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and Cu K-edge XANES, which were determined by the inflection point of the second-derivative spectra. As shown in Figure 2 a, the Ni K-edge XANES spectra of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu and NiI-NCNT@Ni contain different characteristic features to Ni-foil and NiO. The inset in Figure 2 a highlights the pre-edge features of the Ni K-edge XANES spectra, in which the rising edges are located between that for Ni foil and NiO, clearly showing the dominant unique electronic structure of NiI. It is worth noticing that the Ni K-edge XANES spectrum of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu does not overlap with the one of NiI-NCNT@Ni, indicating a charge transfer between nickel and copper in alloy NPs. The Cu K-edge XANES spectrum of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu (Figure 2 b) displays a similar escalating trend of intensity to that of the Cu foil, indicating Cu0 species in Ni–Cu alloy, and an obvious separation at approximately 8978 eV, which can be assigned to the +2 valence state of copper, suggesting the presence of Cu2+ species in Cu–N coordination. The Fourier transform (FT) k3-weight χ(k)-function of the phase-uncorrected extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for Ni (Figure 2 c) in NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu and NiI-NCNT@Ni both exhibit Ni–N coordination with a peak centered at 1.35 Å and Ni–Ni/Cu path at 2.14 Å, resulting from atomically dispersed Ni-N4 sites and encapsulated metal NPs, respectively.5d Similarly, in the Cu EXAFS spectrum as shown in Figure 2 d, the peak around 1.12 Å and 2.21 Å can be attributed to Cu–N coordination and Cu−Ni/Cu metal bond, respectively.9

The chemical compositions and elemental states of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu and NiI-NCNT@Ni, as well as their counterparts before acid treatment were further investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure 3 and Figure S7 b). The high-resolution XPS N 1s spectra of all four samples (Figure 3 a,d) can be deconvoluted into pyridinic (399.0 eV), pyrrolic (400.5 eV), graphitic (401.3 eV) and oxidized (ca. 403 eV) N species. The relatively higher percentage of pyridinic N (59.2 %) for 10.34 at % N in NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu could justify the high loading of single atoms as pyridinic N is generally believed to serve as the coordinating sites for transition metal species. In Figure 3 b, the binding energy of Ni 2p3/2 in NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu is 854.6 eV, which is approximately 1.4 eV lower than that of Ni2+ in nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) (856.0 eV), suggesting a low-valent state of Ni species in NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu nanoarray. This observation also agrees well with the XANES results. Compared to the pristine Ni-NCNT@Ni9Cu without acid leaching, the Ni 2p3/2 peak of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu at 853.5 eV decreases, corresponding to the removal of exposed metallic Ni0 during acid treatment. A similar phenomenon was observed in NiI-NCNT@Ni (Figure 3 e), except with a higher surplus of metallic Ni after acid leaching. The high-resolution XPS Cu 2p spectra of pristine Ni-NCNT@Ni9Cu and acid-leached NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu (Figure 3 c) display the peaks at 932.9 and 933.5 eV, which can be assigned to metallic Cu0 and Cu2+, respectively. The atomic concentrations of Ni and Cu in the NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu nanoarray determined by XPS are 0.90 at % and 0.07 at %, respectively, compared to 2.07 at % and 0.44 at % in Ni-NCNT@Ni9Cu (Table S1).

From the XANES and XPS results, we infer that the oxidation state of the single Ni atoms on CNTs in NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu and NiI-NCNT@Ni is +1. The formation of NiI sites could be attributed to the high percentage of pyridinic N. The unpaired electron in NiI could be directly detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (Figure 3 f). The g value (2.19) of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu in the EPR spectrum is assigned to the unpaired electron in the orbital of NiI and CuII.10 As there are two degenerated 3d electrons in Ni0, the shift of g value (2.10) in NiI-NCNT@Ni is due to the influence of spin–spin strain interaction between numerous metallic Ni NPs (g≈2.00).11
On the basis of the above results, the growth mechanism of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu nanoarray is elucidated. The LDH nanosheet was first reduced to a dense alloy film that subsequently catalyzed the formation of bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes. The homogeneous distribution of the alloy film offered abundant active sites for the growth of the CNT array.7b The formation of bamboo-like CNTs could be attributed to catalytic particle movement with respect to their initial position following the VLS mechanism through the tip-growth.12 The Ni species in the metal NPs provide a surface template for carbon–carbon bond formation, resulting in the nucleation and incorporation of carbon atoms into the growing nanotubes, while Cu species are rarely regarded as the active catalytic sites for CNT growth due to the weak carbon–copper bond (Figure S8).13 When the metal NPs were exposed to nitrogen species on CNTs, the strong metal–nitrogen coordination would split the metal atoms from metal NPs, which were further stabilized by nitrogen within the surface of the CNT array,14 forming atomically dispersed NiI sites. After growth of the CNT array, exposed metal NPs were removed by acid treatment, but carbon-encapsulated metal NPs and single atom metal sites remained in CNTs.15 With further increase of the treatment temperature and acidity, the single atom sites were removed while maintaining the CNT structure (Figure S9) and carbon-encapsulated metal NPs (Figure S10). The calculated Ni single-atom content by ICP-AES of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu, NiI-NCNT@NiCu and NiI-NCNT@Ni is 3.52 wt %, 1.23 wt %, and 4.06 wt %, respectively (Table S3).
Inspired by the unique structural features of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu array, we evaluated its activity for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction in an H-type electrochemical cell separated by a Nafion 117 membrane (Figure S11). Figure 4 a and Figure S12 show the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) results of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu, NiI-NCNT@NiCu, and NiI-NCNT@Ni arrays and CFP in 0.5 m aqueous KHCO3 solution saturated with Ar or CO2. CFP shows negligible CO2 reduction activity and decoration of CFP with NiI-N4 embedded CNT array leads to an improved activity and selectivity towards CO2 reduction. In the mass-transport-limit region, for example, at an applied potential of −0.8 V vs. RHE, the NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu array produced a large cathodic current density of −42 mA cm−2, corresponding to a mass activity of −84 A gcatalyst−1. Typical current profiles for NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu biased at different potentials in a CO2-saturated 0.5 m aqueous KHCO3 (pH 7.23) solution at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for analysis of the reduction products and Faradaic efficiency are shown in Figure S13. The gaseous and liquid products were analyzed by on-line GC, off-line HPLC, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Only CO and H2 were detected in the gas phase, while no liquid products were detectable under applied potentials in the range of −0.23 to −1.03 V vs. RHE. The CO formation (GC data, Figure S14) was detected at a low onset overpotential (ca. 220 mV) for NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu nanoarray, which is consistent with the overpotential determined from the LSV curve. The Faradaic efficiency of CO formation was calculated based on the GC data (Figure 4 b). NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu array exhibits a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of about 97 % at around −0.73 V vs. RHE, higher than that of NiI-NCNT@NiCu array (90 %) and NiI-NCNT@Ni array (75 %). Additionally, the maximum selectivities towards CO formation of all three single-Ni-atom electrodes are much higher than the samples before acid treatment (Figure S15 a). Figure 4 c displays the current density curves for CO (jCO) and H2 (j ) formation. It is found that jCO values increase significantly with increasing Ni content, indicating low-valent NiI species as the active site for CO formation. However, Ni-NCNT@Ni, with the maximum Ni content, displays a large j value, resulting in a high tendency towards the side reaction HER. The catalysts with copper introduction exhibit a suppression of j , with NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu having the highest selectivity for CO formation. As shown in Figure S16, the extremely low current density of the catalysts after high-temperature concentrated acid etching to remove single-atom sites suggests that NiI single atoms are the active sites. The calculated TOF of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu array reaches 1962 h−1 at an overpotential of 620 mV, which is larger than those of noble metal catalysts in aqueous solution.16 Tafel slopes of 98, 106, and 175 mV decade−1 were obtained for NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu, NiI-NCNT@Ni, and NiI-NCNT@NiCu arrays (Figure S15 b), respectively, suggesting that the first electron transfer on nickel active sites by *COOH species adsorption is the rate-determining step for CO evolution.17 The roughness factor (RF) was calculated from the ratio of electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the electrode to the geometric area (Figure S15 c), which is 2401, 2473, and 669 for NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu, NiI-NCNT@Ni, and NiI-NCNT@NiCu arrays. More importantly, the CO2 to CO reduction performance of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu array was very stable, which retained 93 % of the initial current density (−21.5 mA cm−2) after 20 h of continuous reaction and maintained a high selectivity over 90 % (Figure 4 d). The morphology of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu after 20 h of reaction was investigated, and no noticeable changes could be observed relative to the fresh sample (Figure S17). The excellent chemical stability of NiI-NCNT@Ni9Cu array was further confirmed by high-resolution XPS Ni 2p spectrum (Figures S18 and S19) and HAADF-STEM image (Figure S20), which show identical Ni 2p3/2 binding energy (ca. 855 eV) and well-dispersed single-atoms after 20 h of electrochemical CO2 reduction. There could be a trace NiII signal resulted from NiI oxidization by CO2 electrophilic addition during the catalysis.18

The experimental results indicate that the monovalent NiI atomic center provides an efficient and durable catalytically active site for CRR, coinciding with our previous conclusion.4b The construction of the N-doped carbon nanotube array increases the number of exposed monoatomic NiI sites, which at the same time is conducive to charge transport thanks to the 1D aligned nanoarchitecture of the CNT array. The introduction of copper into nickel suppresses the pathway of hydrogen generation, which is effective to eliminate the competition between CRR and HER to further improve the Faradic efficiency of carbon products in CRR (Figure 5 a). DFT calculations were carried out to reveal the HER kinetics and gain more insights into the impact of metal NPs on HER. The adsorption free energy of hydrogen (ΔGH*) was used as a measure to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of HER.19 Based on the Sabatier principle, moderate hydrogen adsorption (ΔGH*=0) gives the optimal HER activity.20 Figure 5 b shows the computational results, according to which, hydrogen likes to adsorb at the high-coordination site on the low-index metal surface, and the hollow site on a face centered cubic (111) surface is the most stable adsorption site for Ni@C.21 The calculated ΔGH* on Ni@C hollow site is +0.08 eV, indicating favorable HER on Ni@C. On the other hand, the ΔGH* on Ni9Cu@C and NiCu@C hollow sites are +0.23 eV and +0.38 eV, respectively, indicating much weaker hydrogen bindings on NiCu@C, which shall greatly suppress HER. In the synthesized catalysts, the electrons of alloys can penetrate through the carbon shell to adjust the adsorption energy of hydrogen on the external carbon surface.22 As shown in the charge redistribution (charge transfer) in the Ni@C−H (Figure 5 c), Ni9Cu@C−H (Figure 5 d), and NiCu@C−H (Figure 5 e) systems, the (111) surface of copper has a smaller work function (4.94) as compared to nickel (5.35), which shall induce electron transfer from copper to nickel,23 and thus enhance the binding strength of Ni@C with H. Furthermore, the calculated ΔGH* for the Ni-N4 sites (Figure 5 f) is +1.92 eV, which is too weak to bind hydrogen because the proton/electron transfer is thermodynamically uphill. To understand why Cu alloying leads to a suppressed HER performance and how Cu addition changes the electronic structure of the alloy NPs, the density of states (DOS) was calculated. With introduction of Cu, the d-band center of nickel was found upshifted,24 increased from −1.520 eV in Ni (Figure 5 g) to −1.438 eV in Ni9Cu (Figure 5 h), leading to a suppression of HER (Figure S23).25

Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated atomically dispersed, low-valent NiI anchored on a N-doped carbon nanotube array with nickel–copper alloy encapsulation on CFP as an effective electrode for CO2 reduction to CO. Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the unique structural features for CO2 activation, charge transport, and hydrogen evolution suppression, which lead to a high performance of CRR.
