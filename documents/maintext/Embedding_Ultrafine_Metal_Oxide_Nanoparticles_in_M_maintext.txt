Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in many electrochemical conversion systems for sustainable energy regeneration. (1−3) The OER process involves the formation of multiple intermediates with four-electron transfer and requires a high operating voltage to overcome the reaction energy barrier, resulting in an unsatisfactory overpotential and energy consumption. (4) Currently, theoretical and experimental research in OER electrocatalysis are simultaneously conducted for the exploration and prediction of highly efficient catalysts with acceptable overpotentials for practical application. (5−7)
First-row (3d) transition-metal-based materials are promising OER electrocatalysts, in the form of their corresponding oxides, (8) oxyhydroxides, (9) and oxide perovskites, (10,11) in which the edge- or corner-sharing octahedral MO6 units are deemed as real catalytic active centers. (12,13) Modulating the 3d electronic structure and configuration of metal center atoms by changing their surrounding chemical environment can optimize reaction intermediate energies and even change reaction pathways, leading to a decrease of reaction barriers and an improvement of the intrinsic electrochemical activity of the center. (14,15) To achieve the desired OER performance, extensive efforts are expended to generate more active metal centers and enhance their intrinsic activity by dimensional control, (16,17) defect creation, (18) doping, (19,20) and surface and interface engineering. (21) In particular, the formation of a heterostructure can create highly active surfaces/interfaces between two different phases for enhanced electrocatalysis. (22−27)
Recently, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a family of promising catalysts to be used directly in the domain of electrochemical water splitting owing to their diverse metal centers/clusters and structural tailorability. (28−31) Furthermore, ultrathin MOF nanosheets have vastly enhanced electrocatalytic performances compared with their bulk counterparts and serve as an ideal model system for mechanism study by combining theoretical and experimental results. (32−34)
Herein, ultrafine metal oxide nanoparticles were embedded in the lattice of a monolayered Co-based MOF to create highly active OER catalytic sites located at the interfaces between two different types of phases. The Co-based MOF with a laminar structure exemplified in this study was poly[Co2(benzimidazole)4] (PCB), in which the CoN4 sites possessed weak OER activity as reported in prior studies. (28,31,34) Metal-oxide-nanoparticle-embedded PCB (M-PCB) bulk microcrystals could be obtained by adding trivalent Fe ions in PCB precursors and further exfoliated to form monolayered M-PCB nanosheets (M-PCBN) by ultrasonication (Figure 1a). Structural characterization and analysis indicated that the inorganic nanoparticle CoFeOx contained a coordination-saturated FeO6 octahedron center, coordination-unsaturated FeO5/CoO5 edge, and interfacial CoO2N2. Theoretical calculations revealed a higher OER activity of the interfacial Co sites in contrast to the CoN4 and FeO6 units. Finally, electrochemical studies revealed that M-PCBN deposited on a carbon cloth substrate possessed a superior electrocatalytic OER performance with a low overpotential of 232 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and a high current density of 55.2 mA cm–2 at 1.53 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), as well as a very small Tafel slope of 32 mV dec–1.

Results and Discussion
As previously reported, mixing divalent cobalt ions and benzimidazole linkers allowed two types of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), namely, ZIF-9 and ZIF-12, to be formed under an N,N-dimethylformamide solvent and an N,N-diethylformamide solvent environment, respectively. (35) In this study, deionized water was used as a solvent to obtain an isomeric MOF (PCB), which had a laminar structure (see Methods, Figures 1a and S1a,b). Its corresponding optical microscope and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images showed that the products were blue-violet crystals with an average size of 10 μm (Figure S1c,d). The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern (Figure 1b) of PCB suggested that it was isostructural to a previously reported Zn-based MOF, poly[Zn2(benzimidazole)4] (no. 675375, Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre). (36,37) Such a layered structure led to the nonporous property of PCB, which exhibited a very low nitrogen adsorption amount and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 0.89 m2 g–1 (Figure 1c). Its transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images clearly revealed the flake-like morphology of PCB (Figure 1d). The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Figure 1d) presented a diffraction fringe from the (002) plane. Quantitative analysis from inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) revealed that PCB contained 19.5 wt % Co, which was very close to the theoretical value of 20.1 wt % calculated from its crystal data.
M-PCB shared the same crystal phase and morphology as PCB, which was confirmed by optical microscopy, FE-SEM, PXRD, and TEM measurements as well as SAED pattern (Figures S2, 1b and e). Compared with the uniform surface of PCB, many dark dots with a lateral size of ∼3 nm were observed from the TEM images of M-PCB. Furthermore, the existence of Co, N, and Fe in elemental maps implied that inorganic nanoparticles were successfully embedded in the PCB structure (Figure S3). The above results indicated that the integrity of the structure was preserved after the embedding of ultrafine inorganic nanoparticles in the MOF lattice. It should be noted that the excess trivalent Fe ions with high oxidation ability could destroy the CoN4-based crystalline structure, leading to a yield loss as the concentration of the Fe precursor for the PCB synthesis increased.
In fact, layered MOFs were difficult to be directly exfoliated through ultrasonication because of the weak coordination bonds in each layer. (37−39) In this case, PCB microcrystals could not be exfoliated, but M-PCB microcrystals were successfully converted into ultrathin nanosheets (M-PCBN) under the same conditions. It should be noted that M-PCB was not completely converted to M-PCBN, and its exfoliation rate was ∼25%. The exfoliated product of M-PCB contained two components. A portion of the product (∼25%) embedded by metal oxide nanoparticles could be easily exfoliated and dispersed into the above solution. The remainder was pure PCB, which could not be exfoliated under the same ultrasonic conditions and precipitates at the bottom. Therefore, the Fe content in M-PCBN (4.14 wt %) was higher than that of M-PCB (1.59 wt %), as calculated by ICP-OES.
It was speculated that the inorganic nanoparticles in the lattice of M-PCB weakened the interactions between adjacent layers, which assisted exfoliation under a mild ultrasonic condition. The slight shift of the (002) diffraction peak at 9.1° in the PXRD pattern of M-PCBN confirmed the increase in its interlayer spacing (Figure S4). The M-PCBN powder obtained by exfoliation and subsequent freeze-drying exhibited an increased volume in contrast to its bulk counterparts (inset of Figure 1b). Although M-PCB with a nonporous structure exhibited a low nitrogen adsorption amount similar to that of PCB, a large increase in the BET surface area from 11.2 m2 g–1 for M-PCB to 98.6 m2 g–1 for M-PCBN further verified the exfoliation of layered bulk crystals to produce ultrathin nanosheets (Figure 1c).
From the TEM images (Figures S5 and 1f), M-PCBN possessed an ultrathin heterogeneous nanosheet structure; its colloid suspension remained well-stabilized in a solution for a long time (inset of Figure S5b) and exhibited a distinct Tyndall effect under laser irradiation (inset of Figure 1f). The TEM image of M-PCBN in Figure 1f clearly shows the wide distribution of high-contrast areas with a lateral size of ∼3 nm, which was consistent with the dark dots in the TEM image of M-PCB. The deep contrast implied that the chemical component and structure of these dark areas differed from CoN4-based PCB, which was further confirmed by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). As shown in Figure 1g, the lattice fringes were indubitably distinct from the PCB matrix and are highlighted by red circles. The lattice fringe spacing was ∼0.252 nm, which was in agreement with the (110) interplanar spacing of hematite (inset of Figure 1g). This result indicated that the inorganic composition in these regions was an Fe-based metal oxide, which was further confirmed by subsequent characterization and analysis. The heterostructure of M-PCBN embedded by ultrafine metal oxide nanoparticles led to long-range disorder within the two-dimensional layer plane, which was reflected in the absence of peaks in the 15–40° region of its PXRD pattern (Figure 1b).
M-PCBN was deposited onto a fresh mica substrate for atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement. Figure 1h shows one large nanosheet (150–200 nm) and three small adjacent nanosheets (<100 nm). From their corresponding height profiles (Figure 1i), line 1 shows that the edge thickness of these nanosheets was ∼1 nm, which was consistent with that of a single layer in the PCB crystal structure. Interestingly, lines 2 and 3 show that the thickness of these nanosheets was between 1.2 and 1.8 nm, which was halfway between the thicknesses of a single and a double layer. Since a half-layer did not exist, it was speculated that the increased height from a single layer could be attributed to the protruding sections of the embedded nanoparticles. All the above results confirmed that the ultrafine nanoparticles were embedded in the lattice of the monolayered CoN4-based MOF to form heterogeneous nanosheets.
Generally, two types of crystals tend to separate into two noninteracting phases. Based on controlled experiments, some possible factors and processes leading to the formation of such heterostructures were proposed herein. First, trivalent Fe ions with high oxidation ability could attack CoN4 sites and substitute Co ions, leading to the structural deterioration of PCB (Figure S6). Second, trivalent Fe ions coordinated with benzimidazole molecules could facilitate the formation of an amorphous oligomer, which was under a kinetics control process (Figure S7a,b). Third, water molecules involved in the system reacted with Fe ions to form thermodynamically stable oxide phases including hematite and goethite, and last, benzimidazole played the role of an organic base to be protonated (Figure S7b–d). Therefore, in the M-PCB synthesis process, the PCB lattice should be partially damaged and filled up with Fe-based oxide units to form such a heterogeneous structure.
Aberration-corrected scanning TEM (STEM) using the high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) mode revealed the local atomic configuration with and without ultrafine nanoparticles in a piece of nanosheet. Two representative HAADF-STEM images are shown in Figure 2a,b, where the ultrafine nanoparticles highlighted by red circles were composed of compact and orderly distributed metal atoms different from the pure CoN4-based structure with monodispersed metal atoms. Elemental composition analysis by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) maps demonstrated the dispersed distributions of Fe and O elements corresponding to the bright areas in the STEM image, as well as the uniform distribution of Co, C, and N shown in Figure 2c, clearly confirming that the metal oxide units were dispersed in the MOF matrix.

(c) STEM image and the corresponding element maps of M-PCBN. (d, e) Normalized XANES curves and EXAFS k2χ(k) FT spectra of PCB, M-PCBN, and Co foil for the Co K-edge.

(g–k) WT contour plots for Co K-edge EXAFS of PCB (g), M-PCBN (h), and Co foil (j) as well as Fe K-edge EXAFS of M-PCBN (i) and Fe foil (k).
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was further employed to investigate the valence states and coordination environments of Co and Fe to confirm the components of metal oxide nanoparticles, and the interface structure between the metal oxide nanoparticles and CoN4 units of the MOF (Figure S8) was subsequently assessed. In Figure 2d, for the normalized Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra, the absorption threshold of M-PCBN was higher than those of standard Co foil and PCB, manifesting that the valence state of Co element in M-PCBN was higher than that (Co2+) in PCB. Therefore, it was verified that Co element in M-PCBN presented not only a common divalent state but also a trivalent state. It was speculated that Co3+ was located at the interface to form Co–O bonds with the metal oxide nanoparticles and Co–N bonds with the MOF matrix.
The extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) fitting results are summarized in Figures 2e,f, and S9 and Table S1. From the Co K-edge EXAFS Fourier transform (FT) spectra (Figure 2e), the dominant peaks at 1.53 and 2.41 Å in R space were assigned to the main Co–N/O coordination and the weak scattering from the C atoms in benzimidazole, respectively. Meanwhile, the fitted Co–N coordination number for PCB was 4.3 ± 0.3 (Table S1), which was very close to the theoretical value (4) of the CoN4 structure. Interestingly, the intensity of the Co–N/O peak in R space and the fitted Co–N/O coordination number (3.4 ± 0.5) for M-PCBN were much lower than those for PCB, indicating that a small portion of Co atoms changed their coordination structure and thus confirming the speculation that the interfaces between the metal oxide nanoparticles and the MOF matrix were connected by Co atoms. The N/O vacancy formation upon exfoliation was another reason for the decrease in the Co coordination number. From the Fe K-edge EXAFS FT spectrum of M-PCBN (Figure 2f), the dominant peak at 1.44 Å was attributed to Fe–O bonds. The fitted Fe–O coordination number was 5.7 ± 0.7, suggesting that the most Fe species were FeO6 octahedra with saturated coordination in metal oxides. Meanwhile, the fitting results demonstrate the inexistence of an Fe–N coordination mode.
The wavelet transform (WT) analysis for the Co and Fe K-edge EXAFS was performed to further confirm the presence of Co element in metal oxide nanoparticles. The WT contour plot for Co K-edge EXAFS of PCB (Figure 2g) exhibited one intense maximum at ∼3.5 Å–1, which was assigned to the Co–N coordination, while that of M-PCBN (Figure 2h) showed a slight shift to ∼3.6 Å–1, which could serve as supporting evidence for the formation of Co–O coordination based on the fact that the relative atomic mass of O is larger than that of N. As shown in Figure 2i, the WT contour plot for Fe K-edge EXAFS of M-PCBN exhibited two intensity centers located at ∼3.9 and 6–8 Å–1, corresponding to the Fe–O and Fe–metal coordination located at 1.44 and 2.67 Å in the Fe K-edge EXAFS FT spectrum. For comparison, the WT contour plots of Co and Fe foils in Figure 2j,k showed that the metallic bonds of Co–Co and Fe–Fe were assigned to ∼6.8 and ∼7.5 Å–1, respectively. In addition, the Fe–metal scattering shell in the WT contour plot of M-PCBN showed that the Fe atom was surrounded by other Fe and Co atoms in the second shell. All the results clearly confirmed that the metal oxide contained both Fe and Co elements.
Based on the above characterization and analysis results, the metal oxide was proposed to be expressed as CoFeOx containing a coordination-saturated FeO6 octahedron center, coordination-unsaturated FeO5/CoO5 edge, and interfacial CoO2N2, which was located at the interfaces between the metal oxide nanoparticles and MOF matrix and connected by Co–O and Co–N bonds, respectively. As shown in Figure 3a,b, coordination-unsaturated CoO5 or FeO5 adjoined with the interfacial CoO2N2 were considered and discussed.

The above structural characterizations established a CoFeOx/MOF interface structure in M-PCBN. Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted to bring about additional atomic insight regarding the structural properties of M-PCBN as well as the influence of the interface structure on OER activity. For this purpose, both the pristine CoN4 sites and interfacial Co locations in M-PCBN were investigated, where the former refers to the CoN4 substructure of PCB and the latter reflects the formed interface structure in M-PCBN. Three independent active Co moieties were constructed accordingly (Figure 3a–c), i.e., the interfacial CoN2O2–CoO5, interfacial CoN2O2–FeO5, and pristine CoN4 (labeled as i-Co-Co and i-Co-Fe and p-CoN4, respectively). Please note that the Fe moiety of the metal oxide nanoparticle was found to be inactive to OER, which was also identified in a previous study. (40) Moreover, these Fe sites preferred to exhibit an FeO6 octahedra configuration with saturated coordination, which was in good agreement with the above EXAFS fitting results.
The charges of Co sites were calculated using Bader charge analysis (41) to investigate the charge variation between pristine and interfacial Co. It was found that the Bader charges of Co on interfacial CoN2O2 (1.25 |e| for i-Co-Co and 1.23 |e| for i-Co-Fe) were larger than those in CoN4 (1.16 |e| for p-CoN4). This suggested that the interfacial Co maintained a higher valence state than the pristine Co in the CoN4 substructure, which was in agreement with the XANES analysis results. It rationalizes the above observed valence states of Co element in PCB and M-PCBN; that is, M-PCBN presented not only a common divalent state but also a trivalent state due to the formation of interfacial Co. Figure 3d shows the molecular orbital energy diagram for tetrahedral ML4 and a comparison of the 3d electronic configuration between Co2+ at the CoN4 sites and Co3+ from the interfacial CoN2O2. The t2* filling in molecular orbital as an activity descriptor indicated better electrocatalytic activity of interfacial Co in terms of its electronic structure.
To determine whether the charge variation was beneficial to the OER process, the free energy diagrams of the three configurations (Figure 3e) were calculated using the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model. (42) The geometric structures of intermediates produced along the catalytic path are presented in Figures S10 and S11. According to DFT calculations, the p-CoN4 site was catalytically poor and its reaction process was limited by an intermediate OH* formation step with a high endothermic free energy of 0.78 eV at the equilibrium potential. Compared with that of p-CoN4, the OH* formation on both i-Co-Co and i-Co-Fe was more energetically favorable. Instead of being impeded by the reduction of O* to OOH*, such endothermic values of the limiting step for both i-Co-Co and i-Co-Fe were significantly reduced to 0.48 and 0.58 eV, respectively. These results suggested that the interfaces of CoFeOx nanoparticles and CoN4 units could facilitate the entire OER process. Figure 3f,g show schematics of the OER processes for the CoN4 site and the i-Co-Co interface. The OER process on i-Co-Fe was the same as that on i-Co-Co. Overall, enhanced OER activity could be expected for the as-prepared M-PCBN.
To verify the above calculation results, the electrochemical OER activities of the exfoliated M-PCBN and bulk PCB and M-PCB were further investigated. Commercial RuO2 and pristine carbon cloth were also tested under the same conditions for comparison. All these electrocatalysts were coated onto carbon cloth (labeled as PCB/CC, M-PCB/CC, M-PCBN/CC, and RuO2/CC) by a drop-casting method and directly used as the working electrode in a typical three-electrode system containing 1 M KOH electrolyte (pH 14) (detailed steps in Methods). Polarization curves for all working electrodes were corrected by 95% iR in Figure S12 (all data in this work were corrected, unless otherwise stated). The OER performance could be evaluated based on the overpotential η at a current density of 10 mA cm–2, the current density j at an operational potential of 1.53 V (versus RHE), and the Tafel slope. (13)
As shown in Figure 4a,b, the PCB/CC electrode showed a moderate activity with an overpotential of 348 mV at 10 mA cm–2, which was similar to those of previously reported MOFs containing CoN4 units. (28,31,34) The overpotential of M-PCB/CC decreased to 316 mV at 10 mA cm–2, which was close to that of RuO2/CC (307 mV), implying that the embedding of metal oxide nanoparticles created highly active sites for OER. Notably, the M-PCBN/CC electrode achieved the best performance with a very low overpotential of 232 mV at the same current density, which outperformed most of the high-performance OER electrocatalysts reported recently (Table S2). On the other hand, it showed the highest current density of 55.2 mA cm–2 at a potential of 1.53 V (versus RHE), which was much higher than those of PCB/CC (1.7 mA cm–2), M-PCB/CC (3.9 mA cm–2), and RuO2/CC (7.3 mA cm–2) (the current density data were real without iR corrections, Figures 4b and S12b). Supplementary Video 1 shows the generation of oxygen bubbles on the M-PCBN/CC electrode under the operational potential range from 1.43 to 1.73 V (versus RHE).

To investigate the influence of the metal oxide content on the OER activity of the products, we further prepared three controlled samples by adjusting the molar ratio of metal precursors and compared their performance (Figures S13 and S14 and their captions). When the low concentration of the Fe precursor was used, the corresponding metal oxide nanoparticles and active interfaces were insufficient, and thus the OER activity of the resultant product was relatively low. On the contrary, the active interfaces in the products were saturated when the molar ratio of the Fe precursor exceeded 20%, resulting in nearly identical polarization curves for these products, indicating the same OER performance. The results further confirmed that the Fe sites in the metal oxide nanoparticles were inactive.
Compared with the Tafel slope of PCB/CC (59 mV dec–1) and M-PCB/CC (54 mV dec–1), that of M-PCBN/CC (32 mV dec–1) dramatically decreased (Figure 4c), indicating more effective kinetics for ultrathin nanosheets in contrast to their bulk counterparts. The fast electrode reaction kinetics of ultrathin nanosheets were further confirmed by the comparison of charge transfer resistance measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Figure S15). Nyquist plots of the working electrodes showed a sharply reduced charge transfer resistance for M-PCBN/CC (0.88 Ω) compared with PCB/CC (21.15 Ω), M-PCB/CC (14.66 Ω), and pristine carbon cloth (75.44 Ω), indicating an accelerated charge transfer rate upon exfoliation. In a continuous chronoamperometry testing (Figure 4d), M-PCBN/CC exhibited a negligible fluctuation of current density at a potential of 0.538 V (versus RHE) for more than 60 h, whereas that of RuO2/CC sharply declined during the first 6 h. Meanwhile, the current density of M-PCB/CC exhibited a significant declining trend during the first 20 h, which was due to the disengagement of bulk PCB crystals from the electrode.
Metal substrates with high conductivity allowed the deposited electrocatalysts to achieve a better electrochemical performance, according to previous studies. (29,32) The glassy carbon electrode could be employed as a benchmark substrate for the further study of electrochemical mechanisms. Therefore, the OER performance of these electrocatalysts on two other substrates, copper foam and glassy carbon electrode, was also investigated. Similar trends in OER activities were observed for PCB, M-PCB, and M-PCBN coated onto different substrates (Figures 4e and S16). As expected, the M-PCBN-coated copper foam exhibited the best activity with a very low overpotential of 185 mV at 10 mA cm–2.
For the evaluation of stability, the morphologies and crystal structures of PCB/CC, M-PCB/CC, and M-PCBN/CC were further investigated before and after 1000 cycles of CV scanning (Figure S17). The consistent cube shapes and XRD patterns of PCB/CC, M-PCB/CC, and M-PCBN/CC confirmed their excellent stability in alkaline media under electrochemical test conditions. The consistent color of the M-PCBN/CC electrode during the electrocatalytic OER test could also be regarded as supporting evidence for the good stability of M-PCBN (Supplementary Video 1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of M-PCBN/CC was conducted before and after the electrocatalytic OER test to investigate the valence states of Co and Fe elements (Figure S18). The predominant peaks of Co 2p and Fe 2p remained invariant after the electrochemical test, indicating that the valence states of Co and Fe in M-PCBN were unchanged.
Electrochemical surface area (ECSA) is a crucial indicator to reflect the accessible active sites in electrocatalysis. ECSA was estimated from the double layer capacitance Cdl of PCB, M-PCB, and M-PCBN using a cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan method. (13,43) The involvement of metal oxide nanoparticles into an MOF structure resulted in a doubled Cdl from PCB (1.01 mF cm–2) to M-PCB (2.12 mF cm–2), as shown in Figures 4f and S19. Furthermore, the Cdl of M-PCBN reached 7.93 mF cm–2, strongly suggesting that exfoliation increased the electrochemically accessible active sites for OER. It was confirmed that the increase in ECSA was proportional to the improved OER performance. To investigate the intrinsic activity of as-prepared electrocatalysts, their polarization curves were normalized by ECSA (Figure S20). M-PCBN/CC still showed the best intrinsic OER performance with the smallest overpotential of 286 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in contrast to those of PCB/CC (357 mV) and M-PCB/CC (376 mV) after ECSA normalization.
All these electrochemical results show that the high-valent Co atoms located at the structure interfaces offer highly active sites for OER, which was in agreement with the DFT calculation results. Upon exfoliation, M-PCBN possessed completely exposed active Co sites and improved fast reaction kinetics, thereby achieving an enhanced electrocatalytic performance.
Conclusion
Ultrafine CoFeOx nanoparticles were embedded in the lattice of a Co-based MOF, which was then further exfoliated into a layered heterostructure to form monolayered heterogeneous nanosheets containing the inorganic nanoparticles. The foreign metal ions in the metal oxide nanoparticles should meet the requirement where the metal ions are able to partly damage the MOF structure and form oxide in the MOF synthesis condition.
The monolayered heterostructure was used as an ideal model for electrocatalytic OER research combined with both theoretical and experimental methods. Notably, HAADF-STEM and XAS analysis indicated the formation of Co sites with high valence states and changed 3d electronic configurations at the interfaces of the metal oxide nanoparticles and monolayered MOF matrix, leading to an enhanced electrocatalytic OER performance that was in agreement with DFT calculations and the electrochemical test. This work provides not only a potential approach to exfoliate layered bulk materials to obtain monolayered nanosheets but also insight on the design of heterocatalysts for highly efficient water electrolysis.

Co(NO3)2·6H2O (144.5 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and added to the benzimidazole suspension solution, which quickly turned blue-violet. The mixture was sealed and magnetically stirred for another 1 min and then maintained at 80 °C for 36 h. After having been cooled to room temperature, the blue-violet product was washed twice with methanol and collected by centrifuging (8000 rpm, 5 min) and overnight drying at 80 °C. The Co content in PCB was calculated to be 19.5 wt % by ICP-OES.
Synthesis of Bulk M-PCB
Benzimidazole (472.6 mg, 4 mmol) was added to a 100 mL screw cap bottle containing 40 mL of deionized water and subjected to magnetic stirring for 15 min, followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 1 min. Co(NO3)2·6H2O (144.5 mg, 0.5 mmol) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (40.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and added to the benzimidazole suspension solution, which quickly turned orange. The mixture was sealed and magnetically stirred for another 1 min and then maintained at 80 °C for 36 h. After it had cooled to room temperature, the purple product was washed with methanol several times until the supernatant was clean and collected by centrifuging (8000 rpm, 5 min) and drying at 80 °C overnight. The Co and Fe contents in M-PCB were calculated to be 19.3 and 1.59 wt %, respectively, by ICP-OES.
Preparation of Monolayered M-PCBN
The exfoliation of bulk M-PCB to form monolayered M-PCBN underwent two steps. In the first step, the washed bulk M-PCB was dispersed in methanol and continuously ultrasonicated (40 kHz) for 2 h. After keeping the ultrasonicated suspension under a quiescent condition at room temperature for 24 h, the orchid suspension solution containing exfoliated nanosheets was collected, and the blue-violet precipitate was discarded. The collected product was dispersed in water and freeze-dried to obtain the exfoliated nanosheets. In the second step, the above-mentioned nanosheets (2 mg) were added into a mixed solution of methanol (10 mL) and 1-propanol (10 mL) before being continuously ultrasonicated (40 kHz) in an ice bath for 2 h. Finally, the monolayered M-PCBN was obtained. The Co and Fe content in M-PCB were calculated to be 18.4 and 4.14 wt %, respectively, by ICP-OES.
Control Experiments
Benzimidazole (472.6 mg, 4 mmol) was added to a 100 mL screw cap bottle containing 40 mL of deionized water and subjected to magnetic stirring for 15 min, followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 1 min. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (202 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water and then added to the benzimidazole suspension solution. The mixture was sealed (transferred into a 125 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave) and magnetically stirred for another 1 min before being maintained at 80 °C (or 110 °C) for 36 h. After having cooled to room temperature, the final product was washed and dispersed into methanol for investigation.
Characterization
Optical microscopy images were obtained using a ZEISS Axioskop 2 MAT. FE-SEM images were obtained using a JEOL JSM-7600F scanning electron microscope with the electron beam voltage at 2 kV. XRD was conducted on a Shimadzu 6000 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm). Nitrogen sorption was measured using a QuadraSorb SI BET automated surface area and pore size analyzer at 77 K. AFM measurement was conducted by a Park System’s NX20 with true noncontact mode. Larger ultrathin nanosheets could possess wrinkles and bubbles in their centers, resulting in higher centers compared with the edges. Therefore, measurements near the edges of these nanosheets were taken in order to determine their true thicknesses. TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1400Plus at 120 kV. HRTEM images were collected on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin TEM at 300 kV. HAADF-STEM characterization was conducted on a JEOL ARM-200F (S)TEM equipped with a CEOS CESCOR aberration corrector operating at 80 kV. Co and Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were obtained through a beamline 4B7A station of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (China). The obtained XAFS data were processed in Athena (version 0.9.25) for background, pre-edge line, and postedge line calibrations, before the Fourier transformed fitting was carried out in Artemis (version 0.9.25). The k2 weighting, k-range of 3–13 Å–1, and R range of 1–3 Å were used for two-shell fitting. The models of bulk Co, Fe, Fe2O3, and PCB were used to calculate the simulated scattering paths. The parameters, coordination number, bond length, Debye–Waller factor, and E0 shift (CN, R, σ2, ΔE0), were fitted without any constraints. For wavelet transform analysis, the χ(k) exported from Athena was imported into the Hama Fortran code. The parameters are listed as follows: R range, 1–3 Å; k range, 0–13 Å–1; and k weight, 2, and the Morlet function with κ = 5, σ = 1 was used as the mother wavelet to provide the overall distribution.
Computational Details
First-principles DFT computations were conducted using the projector-augmented plane wave method (44,45) and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional, (46) as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package code. (47,48) A plane-wave cutoff energy of 400 eV and a Gaussian smearing of 0.10 eV with spin polarization included in all calculations were applied. The atomic structures were fully relaxed using a k-point sampling of 3 × 3 × 1 until the maximum force on each ion was less than 0.02 eV Å–1. The van der Waals interactions were described using Grimme’s D3 scheme. (49) The PBE+U approach introduced by Dudarev etal. (50) was applied to describe the strongly correlated d electrons. The effective Hubbard-U parameter was taken as 3.52 eV for Co and 3.50 eV for Fe. (51) The nonspherical contributions from the gradient corrections were included to obtain accurate total DFT energies, EDFT. Free energies of species were calculated using the equation , where EZPE and TS denote the zero-point energy and entropic contribution (T = 298.15 K), respectively. The solvent effects on OOH* and OH* were described using the Poissson–Boltzmann implicit solvation model, (52) where the dielectric constant was taken to be 80. The effects of electrode potential U and pH on the reaction paths were treated as GU = −eU and GpH = −kBT ln 10 × pH, and the plotted free energy diagrams were corrected to the standard form.
Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical measurements were conducted using a three-electrode system on a Zennium Pro potentiostat (Zahner, Germany). Carbon cloth and copper foam (2 × 0.5 cm2), as well as a glassy carbon disk with a diameter of 5 mm, served as substrates to load electrocatalysts for the working electrodes. A graphite rod and Hg/HgO (1 M KOH) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Typically, 4 mg of electrocatalysts was added to the mixed solution containing 0.6 mL of methanol and 0.6 mL of 1-propanol to form a homogeneous ink by ultrasonic dispersion. Subsequently, a fixed volume of ink was pipetted onto the carbon cloth (loading: 0.928 mg cm–2), copper foam (loading: 0.928 mg cm–2), and glassy carbon electrode (loading: 0.16 mg cm–2). After natural drying, these working electrodes were coated with Nafion by drop-casting a dilute Nafion solution (0.5 wt %) for further testing. The CV for all working electrodes was scanned to reach a stable state within an O2-saturated 1 M aqueous KOH electrolyte with a scan rate of 100 mV s–1; then linear sweep voltammetry was performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1. Tafel slopes were calculated from the corresponding polarization curves at a low current density range by the following equation: η = b log j + a, where η, j, and b denote the overpotential, current density, and Tafel slope, respectively. The measured potential was converted against RHE according to the equation ERHE = EHg/HgO + 0.098 + 0.059 × pH. A 95% iR-correction for polarization curves was performed to evaluate the overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm–2 and calculate the Tafel slopes. EIS was recorded with an ac voltage amplitude of 10 mV within a frequency range from 100 000 to 0.1 Hz at a DC potential of 0.606 V versus Hg/HgO. The ECSA measurements used the glassy carbon electrode to load electrocatalysts for the working electrode by a CV scan method. (13) The CV curves were recorded under a potential window of 0.3–0.4 V versus Hg/HgO with increasing scan rates from 20 to 120 mV s–1. Cdl was calculated by plotting Δj at 0.35 V versus Hg/HgO against scan rates. The current density normalized by ECSA was calculated using the equation jECSA-normalized = j/ECSA. (53) The chronoamperometry was recorded at a potential of 0.538, 0.67, and 0.60 V versus Hg/HgO for M-PCBN/CC, M-PCB/CC, and RuO2/CC, respectively. The stability test was conducted by performing 1000 cycles of CV scanning under a potential window of 0–0.6 V versus Hg/HgO at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1. For the morphological investigation after the stability test, electrocatalysts were directly deposited on the carbon cloth without Nafion addition and further ultrasonication to form ink.
