This method enables large-scale synthesis that offers superior uniformity, solution dispersity and controllable concentration of oxygen vacancies on surface. The large surface area of porous cobalt oxide nanoplates together with enriched oxygen vacancies provide more active sites, which promote faster exchange of intermediates and more efficient electron transfer. The as prepared cobalt oxide nanoplates manifest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential as low as 306 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH, which is superior to the values of most reported Co-based electrocatalysts.

. Accordingly, the exploration of abundant, highly efficient, and economic alternatives for water splitting is crucial in terms of solving global energy crisis and environmental challenges. Recently, earth-abundant and environmentally friendly transition-metals-based oxides (Co, Ni, Fe) have exhibited superior performance in OER catalysis due to their reasonable reactivity and stability

[23]

Increasing the reactivity and number of active sites are two effective means to improve electrocatalytic performance
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]

[27]
. Ultra-thin two dimensional (2D) transition metal oxides (TMOs) were therefore chosen as the starting material, due to their large surface area, exposed active sites, and short diffusion lengths of ions and electrons

Recently, the incorporation of oxygen vacancies has been found to remarkably increase the reactivity of active sites, leading to significant improvement of OER performance

. However, the most commonly used method of creating oxygen vacancies, i.e., reduction under high-temperature annealing, is accompanied by morphological deformation and severe aggregation, which may then greatly decrease the effective surface area
[40]
. Due to the high reaction rate at high temperatures, fine-tuning of concentration of oxygen vacancies is extremely difficult to achieve. To this end, a novel wet chemical synthesis strategy that enables large-scale synthesis of homogenous 2D ultrathin nanostructures with fine-tuning concentration of oxygen vacancies would represent a great breakthrough that may allow us to combine advantages of high specific surface area and highly reactive sites.
Herein, we report a ligand-assisted polyol reduction method that allows successful conversion of Co(OH)2 nanoplates into CoOx with well-maintained morphology and at the same time offers an opportunity for effectively creation of oxygen vacancies of controllable concentration on surface. More specifically, Co(OH)2 nanoplates, which can be easily prepared through the hydrolysis of CoCl2, are modified with polyacrylic acid (PAA) through the coordination interaction between cobalt cations and the carboxyl groups. With multiple carboxyl groups, PAA forms a crosslinked network on the surface of Co(OH)2, which allows the transformation of Co(OH)2 nanoplates through polyol reduction in diethylene glycol (DEG) at relatively high temperature without losing their original plate morphology
[41]
. This seemingly simply procedure has subtly solved the most challenging problem of simultaneously fabricating 2D nanostructures and generating oxygen vacancies. The chemical conversion strategy makes it possible to produce CoOx nanocrystals, which usually do not grow two-dimensionally due to the limitation of its intrinsic crystal symmetry, with a plate morphology by taking advantage of the shape of the Co(OH)2 precursor. The phase transition from Co(OH)2 to CoOx is accompanied by volume shrinkage, which causes the formation of pores on the nanoplates and further increases the effective surface area. In addition, the mild solution-phase reduction reaction allows convenient scale up for mass production, and enables effective creation of oxygen vacancies in a controllable manner while avoids typically used high-temperature hydrogen reduction method, which could cause severe aggregation of nanoplates. More importantly, the resulting oxygen-vacancy-rich nanoplates show excellent catalytic performance, manifesting OER overpotential as low as 306 mV at 10 mA/cm2.
α-Co(OH)2 hexagonal nanoplates were synthesized with a previously reported method with minor revision
[42]
. Typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shown in
Fig. 1
A reveals an almost perfect hexagonal plate-like structure with width in the range of 1–2 µm. These plates are uniform and thin with a thickness of around 15 nm as illustrated in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image in
Fig. S1
. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (
Fig. 1
E) exhibited perfect hexagonally arranged diffraction spots, which can be readily indexed as the two-dimensional in-plane reflection with [001] crystal planes on the surface. Subsequently, the classic polyol process was performed through hot injection of the nanoplates into DEG at 220 °C. The reaction was quenched to room temperature at different points in time (1, 2 and 4 h) and the respective intermediates were separated by centrifugation and examined using TEM (shown in
Fig. 1
B-D). The surface structure of the hexagonal platelets was well maintained during the chemical transformation while the interior part became more and more porous, due to the volume shrinkage caused by the dehydration of Co(OH)2 and phase transition. As shown in
Fig. 1
F-H, the corresponding SAED patterns changed rapidly upon DEG reduction, indicating the phase transition. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses, as shown in
Fig. 1
I-J, helped clarify the component of Co(OH)2 before and after reduction during the phase transition process. In
Fig. 1
I, the as-synthesized Co(OH)2 shows two prominent reflection peaks in the XRD pattern, including 003 and 006 reflections of the hydrotalcite-like structure. With its green color, the sample can be determined as α-Co(OH)2
[42]
. The samples upon conversion in polyols are denoted as CoOx, which show three predominant peaks corresponding to the 111, 200 and 220 facets of CoO phase (JCPDS No. 43-1004) (
Fig. 1
J). As the reduction time increases from 1 h to 4 h, the diffraction peaks become sharper and narrower, indicating more complete conversion from Co(OH)2 to CoO and improved crystallinity. Further confirmation of the phase transition can be seen from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images in
Fig. S2
of supporting information. As shown in
Fig. S2
A-C, CoO phase with d-spacing of (111) planes with 0.25 nm was observed after DEG reduction for 1, 2 and 4 h.

The role PAA played during surface protected reduction process was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). To verify the coordination interaction between the carboxyl groups of PAA and Co ions, FTIR was performed for PAA, bare Co(OH)2 and PAA modified Co(OH)2. As shown in
Fig. 2
A, PAA displays a strong peak around 1700 cm−1, which corresponds to the typical stretching mode of C˭O double bonds of the carboxyl group. The as-synthesized Co(OH)2 without any surfactant displays a characteristic peak at 3400 cm−1 originated from the hydroxyl group of cobalt hydroxide. After PAA modification, a new peak emerges at 1560 cm−1 in the spectrum. Considering that the electrons around C˭O could be pulled towards the metal atom during coordination, resulting in low electron density around C˭O, reduced stiffness of C˭O bond, and decreased stretching frequency, it is reasonable to assume that the peak around 1560 cm−1 is caused by carboxyl groups of PAA, which confirms the coordination interaction between PAA and cobalt cations. The importance of PAA to the reduction reaction was revealed by ICP-OES measurement (
Fig. 2
B). In a typical synthesis process, one batch of Co(OH)2 was evenly divided into 6 aliquots and each aliquot was injected into the hot DEG solutions which contain different amounts of PAA. After a one-hour reaction, the surviving components were removed by centrifugation and the dissolved Co ions in the supernatant was collected and analyzed by ICP-OES. Without any protection, 24% of the Co species in Co(OH)2 was dissolved by DEG.
Fig. S3
details the dissolving process by TEM. The surface of the Co(OH)2 platelets were quickly corrupted within 15 min of the reaction and almost lost their original shape within an hour. By increasing the time to 4 h, the majority of the sample was dissolved. However, when the concentration of PAA in DEG was increased to around 200 mg/L, the dissolution amount was dramatically decreased to below 6%, which demonstrated the adequate protection ability of PAA. However, due to the acidity of PAA, increasing the PAA to 400 mg/L increased dissolution to 15%. The protection and etching effect were further confirmed by TEM and SEM imaging of samples (
Fig. S4
). The samples prepared in 100 and 400 mg/L PAA/DEG solutions appear more porous in the TEM images and with lighter contrast in the SEM images, indicating a smaller thickness caused by dissolving and etching, which is consistent with the ICP-OES results.

To highlight the unique advantage of the ligand-assisted polyol reduction method, cobalt oxide was directly synthesized through calcination (CoO-cal) at 300 °C for 2 h in Ar as a control sample (
Fig. S5
), and then compared with CoOx samples prepared with DEG reduction for different lengths of time by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The fine-scanned Co 2p XPS spectra are given in
Fig. 3
A, displaying peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 at approximately 780 and 796 eV, respectively. The two satellite peaks centered at approximately 786 and 803 eV, which belong to Co2+ oxidation sate, confirming their CoO chemical nature
[43]
,
[44]
,
[45]
. To get further insight of the surface properties, we fit the curves by Gaussian-Lorentz functions to investigate the electronic states of Co atoms. The two fitted peaks for Co 2p2/3 could be assigned to Co3+ (B.E. 779 eV) and Co2+ (B.E. 781 eV)
[46]
. The appearance of Co3+ could be attributed to inevitable oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+during the initial synthesis of the nanostructures, which has been observed previously
[47]
. Compared to pristine Co(OH)2 (
Fig. S5
), the relative atomic ratio of Co2+/Co3+ on the surface of CoO-cal is barely affected. However, the Co2+/Co3+ ratio of catalysts prepared by the polyol reduction method was dramatically increased, indicating the generation of oxygen vacancies on the surface, which could then be further confirmed by the fine-scanned O 1s XPS spectra. CoO-cal shows two oxygen peaks in the O 1s spectra whereas CoOx (15 min,1, 2, 4 h) shows four oxygen peaks. In detail, the peaks at 529, 531, 532 and 534 eV are associated with Co–O bonds, hydroxyl species, oxygen vacancies or defects (Ovac) and surface adsorbed water molecules
[48]
,
[49]
,
[50]
. The absence of a peak at 532 eV in CoO-cal spectra indicates that CoO-cal lacks oxygen defects on its surface, which is also the case in pristine Co(OH)2 (
Fig. S6
). However, the large Ovac peak areas for CoOx in
Fig. 3
B(ii-v) demonstrate that the ligand-assisted polyol reduction method is very effective in creating oxygen vacancies on the surface. Additionally, the calculated atomic concentration of Ovac/O demonstrates that by simply extending the reduction time from 15 min to 4 h, the concentration of Ovac on surface can be increased from 13% to 31%. This is also consistent with the atomic ratio decrease of Co2+/Co3+ in the Co spectra. It is worth noting that the calculated concentration of oxygen vacancies reflects the surface structure only, whereas the relative concentration of the oxygen vacancies of the bulk is believed to be much smaller
[51]

Subsequently, the OER performance of oxygen-vacancy-enriched cobalt oxides was evaluated using a standard three-electrode system in 1 M KOH. To minimize the capacitive current, a slow scan rate of 5 mV/s was applied to obtain the polarization curves. As shown in
Fig. 4
A, the onset potential for OER on CoOx-4h is 1.54 V, versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which has the lowest onset potential of the six samples and the best OER performance. The overpotential values of the six samples at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 are illustrated in
Fig. 4
B. The pristine Co(OH)2 and cobalt oxide prepared by calcination displayed overpotentials above 340 mV, while the cobalt oxides with increasing oxygen vacancy exhibited significant decrease in overpotentials. The lowest overpotential was achieved by CoOx-4h, at only 306 mV, making it one of the best cobalt based OER electrocatalysts reported (
Table S1

,
[37]

[52]
,
[53]

[54]

[55]
,
[56]

[57]
. Moreover, the corresponding current densities of the six samples at the overpotential of 330 mV are presented in
Fig. 4
C. CoOx-4h showed the highest current density of 21 mA/cm2, which was about 3 times larger than the pristine Co(OH)2 and CoO-cal. The enhanced activity could be attributed to the large surface area and high concentration of oxygen vacancies of CoOx-4h. Further activity evaluation could be seen from Tafel plots (
Fig. 4
D). The Tafel slope of CoOx enriched with oxygen vacancies was calculated to be approximately 65 mV/dec, which was much smaller than the Co(OH)2 (97 mV/dec) and CoO-cal (90 mV/dec); this indicated that faster OER kinetics can be achieved by introducing oxygen vacancies. The activities of CoOx-4h, CoO-cal and Co(OH)2 were also expressed in apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs), assuming that all the metal ions in the nanoplates were active (supplementary
Table S2
)
[58]
,
[59]
,
[60]
. Furthermore, to evaluate the durability of the catalysts, the chronopotentiometry curve was measured for CoOx enriched with oxygen vacancies. As illustrated in
Fig. 4
E, there is no significant increase in the potential during continuous electrolysis, verifying its reliable stability. High activity with reliable stability enables the wide application of oxygen-vacancy-enriched CoOx. To gain a deeper understanding of the superior OER performance of CoOx-4h, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of CoOx-4h, CoO-cal and Co(OH)2 were performed over a potential range of 1.05–1.55 V (v.s. RHE). As shown in
Fig. 4
F, for both electrodes, two distinct pairs of redox peaks are observed around 1.15 and 1.45 V, which could be assigned to the Co(III)/Co(II) and Co(IV)/Co(III) conversion process. The increase of oxidation current at higher potential (> 1.5 V) is attributed to the water oxidation reaction. Compared to the pristine Co(OH)2, the CoOx-4h shows a negatively shifted oxidation peak around 1.15 V, indicating the easier formation of Co(III). Therefore, the higher reactivity of the active sites for OER could be attributed to the oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the dramatically increased current density of CoOx-4h over the entire potential range suggests a much larger electrochemically active surface area. To further confirm the stability of the catalyst, CoOx-4h after OER cycling was characterized by XPS to verify the valence of cobalt ion and the concentration of oxygen vacancies. As shown in
Fig. S7
, neither obvious change of Co3+/Co2+ ratio nor concentration of oxygen vacancies were observed, demonstrating good stability of our catalyst.

According to these results, the enhanced OER performance of CoOx prepared through the ligand-assisted polyol reduction method can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the large surface area and abundant surface oxygen vacancies. The 2D ultrathin nanoplate-like structure of CoOx provides large surface area, abundant active sites and short diffusion lengths for ions and electrons. Previous work and DFT calculations have confirmed that the oxygen vacancies near the surface lowers the adsorption energy of H2O and increases active sites around these defects. Oxygen vacancies also enable weaker metal-oxygen bonds to yield faster exchange of intermediates and electrons
[20]
,
[26]
,
[32]
,
[38]
. To elucidate the more important role of oxygen vacancies, the effect of surface area was studied. Firstly, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measuring was performed on CoO-cal and CoOx-4h. As shown in N2 adsorption/desorption isothermals in
Fig. S8
, CoO-cal and CoOx-4h showed similar surface area of 51.54 and 30.36 m2/g respectively. However, in the absence of oxygen vacancies, CoO-cal was found to be inferior to CoOx-4h in catalytic performance. Thus, the improvement of the OER performance upon prolonging the reduction time can be attributed to the increased concentration of oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the relationship between reduction time, oxygen vacancies and OER performance was plotted in
Fig. S9
, which further confirmed that oxygen vacancies played a more important role in the superior OER performance of CoOx-4h.
In summary, we have developed a ligand-assisted polyol reduction method to produce well-defined cobalt oxide porous nanoplates enriched with controllable oxygen vacancies, which exhibit remarkable OER performance. With the help of a coordinating polymer ligand, the polyol reduction reaction enables successful conversion of Co(OH)2 nanoplates into CoOx with greatly suppressed morphological deformation and at the same time allows the creation of oxygen vacancies on the nanoplates surface. The concentration of the oxygen vacancies on surface could be conveniently controlled by the reduction time, reaching 31%, which is rarely reported. The large surface area originated from the 2D porous structure and the abundant active sites due to oxygen vacancies are extremely beneficial for OER performance, achieving overpotential values as low as 306 mV at 10 mA/cm2. Besides providing a new high-performance OER catalyst, this work also proposes a general and scalable strategy to create controllable concentration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of nanoscale materials while preventing significant morphological changes during phase transition.
Cobalt (II) chloride hexahydrate, PVP (Mw. 55000), hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), diethylene glycol (DEG), polyacrylic acid (PAA) (Mw. 1800), KOH, Nafion and isopropanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and ethanol (200 proof) was purchased from Decon Laboratories. All chemicals were used as purchased without further purification.
The synthesis of Co(OH)2 nanoplates was based on a previous report with slight modifications
[42]
. In a typical synthesis, 0.48 g CoCl2·6H2O, 0.2 g PVP (Mw. 55000), and 0.28 g hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) were dissolved in 80 mL of a 9:1 mixture of deionized H2O and ethanol. The reaction solution was then refluxed at about 95 °C for 2 h. The nanoplates were then isolated by centrifugation and washed with water several times.
The surface of Co(OH)2 nanoplates were functionalized with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) at first. In a typical procedure, 30 mg of Co(OH)2 and 1 mL PAA solution (7.2 mg/mL) were added to 20 mL of deionized water under sonication. The mixture was then stirred for 12 h to allow the functionalization of nanoplates. Afterwards, the excess PAA in the solution was removed by centrifugation and the Co(OH)2 nanoplates were dispersed in 2 mL diethylene glycol (DEG).
In a three-neck flask, 30 mL DEG was heated up to 220 °C under N2 atmosphere. Then, 2 mL DEG solution of Co(OH)2 was injected into the hot DEG solution with magnetic stirring. After incubation for a certain length of time, the product was collected by centrifugation and washed with ethanol/H2O mixture solution several times.
30 mg of as-prepared Co(OH)2 was placed in a crucible and calcined in an oven at 300 °C for 2 h under Ar atmosphere. The temperature was increased at 2.5 °C/min and the flow rate of Ar is 40 cm3/min.
The morphology of the initial Co(OH)2 nanoplates, CoO, is prepared with surface protected reduction method and calcination, characterized by using a Tecnai T12 transmission electron microscope. The large-scale images of the samples were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope XL30-FEG. The crystal phases of the products were examined with X-ray diffraction (Bruker SMART APEX2), in a range of 2θ from 5 to 80°. The concentration of cobalt ions was analyzed with Perkin-Elmer Optima 7300DV ICP-OES apparatus, which combined an SCD detector and an echelle optical system. All FTIR spectra were characterized by Nicolet 6700. The chemical state and electronic state of the elements on the surface were measured with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AXIS ULTRA).
The electrochemical tests were conducted on a Princeton VersaSTAT 4 electrochemical workstation with a typical three-electrode cell. The three-electrode cell is composed of: a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum foil counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode. For the working electrode preparation, catalysts (5 mg) and Nafion solution (50 μL) were added to the mixture solution of isopropanol (250 μL) and water (750 μL), followed by sonication to achieve a good dispersion. Then the dispersed catalysts were casted on the glassy carbon (3 mm in diameter) with 0.5 mg/cm2. The linear sweep voltammetry curves were recorded at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. Chronopotentiometry curve was obtained at a constant current density of 5 mA/cm2. Cyclic voltammetry curves were recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV/s. The conversion of potential against RHE was based on the following equation
