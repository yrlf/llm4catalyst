Nonprecious metal catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are critical to the development of fuel cells. (1−3) In the field, a grand challenge is the nature of the active site structure. Currently, pyrolyzed ternary Fe/N/C catalysts have been extensively studied, and their active sites are likely to be as FeN4. (4−8) In 2009, Dai’s group reported that N-doped carbon nanotubes without Fe doping are also active for ORR. (9) Since then, considerable attention has been paid to so-called metal-free carbon-based catalysts. Although notable progress has been achieved in catalytic activity, (10−14) the chemical nature of the active sites and the ORR mechanism on N-doped carbon materials are not clear yet. Several efforts have been devoted to figuring out the relationship between different N species and ORR activity. (15−18) For example, Guo et al. synthesized N-doped carbon model catalysts with controllable N species on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and found a linear relationship between the content of pyridinic N and ORR activity. (15) This result provides elementary information about active species in N-doped carbon materials. On the basis of them, more efforts should be devoted to study how O2 is bounded to the specific sites of the catalyst. Xing et al. proposed an ORR intermediate species, an −OH group attaching to a carbon atom neighboring pyridinic nitrogen, by comparing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared (IR) spectra of N-doped graphene before and after the ORR test. (19) Note that due to the heterogeneous nature of N-doped graphene, the evidence to identify such a structure based only on peak deconvolution of XPS and IR is not conclusive, especially considering that the oxidation of the carbon matrix during ORR can also introduce the OH group on carbon. Therefore, more experimental evidence is required for further understanding of the chemical nature of active sites.
The molecular probe approach is effective to investigate the properties of catalyst metal sites. Inspired by that, some studies have been reported to utilize traditional molecular probes in the studies of Fe/N/C catalysts. (20−22) However, the molecular probe approach is based on the coordination reaction between the probe molecule and metal site; thus, it is unable to provide effective information on the metal-free carbon material surface.
Herein, we developed a new approach based on highly selective chemical modification of N-doped graphene to reveal the active sites. Inspired by a selective substitution reaction for quinoline derivative in organic synthesis, (23−25) the pyridinic ring on N-doped graphene was highly selectively grafted by the acetyl group at the pyridinic N atom (denoted as N_Ac) and ortho-C atom (denoted as C_Ac) through electrophilic and free radical reactions, respectively. We observed that N_Ac had an ORR activity comparable to that of original N-doped graphene, while C_Ac was completely inert for ORR, confirming that the ortho-C atom of the pyridinic ring is the reactive site for ORR. We further carried out DFT calculations for the generation of the active structure under working condition, screened out the active sites with the free energy diagrams of ORR, and revealed the reason for the distinct ORR activity between N_Ac and C_Ac.
N-doped graphene catalyst was prepared by heat treatment (950 °C) of graphene oxide in an NH3 (10%) + Ar (90%) atmosphere for 0.5 h. The selective chemical modification of the acetyl group on the N atom and ortho-C atom of the pyridinic ring was achieved by electrophilic and radical substitution, respectively (Figures S1 and S2). The N and ortho-C atoms of the pyridinic ring have different electronic properties and chemical reactivity. According to the previous report, (25) the N atom of the pyridinic ring has lone pair electrons and is electrophilic, while the C atom at the ortho position tends to carry out free radical reactions in organic synthesis. Therefore, we used acetyl chloride and acetyl radical (generated from the oxidation of CH3CHO by (CF3COO)2IPh (25) to pretreat the N-doped graphene catalyst, which can induce acetyl group selectively attaching to the N atom and ortho-C atoms of the pyridinic ring, respectively, as depicted in Scheme 1. Note that after targeting the electrophilic reaction, a follow-up oxidative reaction may happen, as depicted in Scheme 1 also, when the sample is exposed to oxygen, which produces an amide species. (23,25) The reason for the reaction is that the ortho-C atom becomes very electrophilic after pyridine reacts with a Lewis acid to form a pyridinium cation, which is a common strategy to activate the ortho position of the pyridinic ring. (24)

An ORR test was carried out in O2-saturated 0.1 M H2SO4 solution by a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) at 900 rpm. Figure 1a,b shows steady-state cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of N_Ac and C_Ac catalysts in Ar- and O2-saturated 0.1 M H2SO4 solution at 10 mV s–1. The subtraction of CVs between O2 and Ar results in the ORR polarization curve, as shown in Figure 1c. Clearly, N_Ac exhibited considerable ORR activity for ORR at a potential lower than 0.70 V. In contrast, C_Ac was completely inert for ORR as the CVs recorded in O2- and Ar-saturated solutions were overlapped. Figure 1c shows the comparison of ORR polarization curves among original N-doped graphene, graphene, N_Ac, and C_Ac catalysts. The original CVs of N-doped graphene and graphene are depicted in Figure S3. Obviously, the N_Ac sample exhibited an ORR activity comparable to that of original N-doped graphene and maintained about 88% of current density at 0.40 V for ORR (Figure 1d). In addition, the onset potentials are close to both cases. We further carried out methylation of the pyridinic N atom (PyN–CH3+). The obtained sample also possessed ORR catalytic activity similar to that of N-doped graphene (Figure S4). These results confirm that attaching a functional group on the pyridinic N atom of N-doped graphene will not affect the ORR activity obviously.

(c) Polarization curves of N-doped graphene (black), graphene (green), N_Ac (blue), and C_Ac (red) in O2-saturated 0.1 M H2SO4 solution. (d) Comparison of normalized currents at 0.40 V for different catalysts. The original N-doped graphene was used as the reference.
On the contrary, the C_Ac sample lost ORR catalytic activity completely, and its ORR current density was even as low as that of graphene without N-doping (Figure 1c,d). Preparation of the C_Ac sample involves the (CF3COO)2IPh free radical initiator, which has a weak oxidative ability. Therefore, we carried out a control experiment by pretreating N-doped graphene only with (CF3COO)2IPh and without CH3CHO. ORR activity was preserved for this control sample (Figure S5). This rules out the possibility that the inactivation of C_Ac for ORR is caused by the free radical initiator.
When the pyridinic N of N-doped graphene was grafted by the acetyl group, most of the ORR activity could be preserved. In contrast, when the ortho-carbon of pyridinic ring was blocked, the ORR activity was suppressed completely. This is conclusive experimental evidence that the ortho-C atom of the pyridinic ring acts as the reactive site for ORR on N-doped graphene.
To check the structure of N_Ac and C_Ac as designed, we carried out XPS and IR characterization. Figure 2a depicts the high-resolution N 1s XPS of original N-doped graphene, N_Ac, and C_Ac samples. The N 1s spectrum of N-doped graphene can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 398.5, 399.9, 400.7, and 402.0 eV, corresponding to pyridinic N, amide N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively. (15,19,26) The main species is the pyridinic N, whose content is about 47%. First, we compared the spectroscopic characters between N-doped graphene and N_Ac. The peak at 398.5 eV, assigned to pyridinic N, was weakened markedly after the modification of the acetyl group on the pyridinic N atom, and a peak at 399.9 eV was enhanced simultaneously. The content of this N species is approximately 66%. This indicates that part pyridinic N species had been converted into the N species at 399.9 eV, which was assigned to amide N in some cases. (15,23) To confirm this assignment, we tested the N 1s XPS of two model organic molecules with pyridinic N, quinoline (1) and 1-acetyl-quinolin-2-one (2), whose structures are relevant to the pyridine ring of N-doped graphene and N_Ac, respectively. Clearly, compound 1 shows a N 1s peak at 398.8 eV, while the peak at 400.1 eV is for compound 2 (Figure 2b). Such a shift in the binding energy of N 1s is in good agreement with that observed between N-doped graphene and N_Ac. Second, we compared the N 1s XPS between N-doped graphene and the C_Ac sample. The pyridinic N peak slightly shifted from 398.5 to 398.9 eV after the ortho-carbon was grafted by the acetyl group, which is also consistent with a model molecule of 1-(quinolin-2-yl)ethan-1-one (3), as shown in Figure 2b. Therefore, the peak at 398.9 eV of the C_Ac sample could be assigned to the pyridinic N with the ortho-C atom grafted by an acetyl group, and its content is about 36%. In addition, a new peak appeared at 400.3 eV, which may be assigned to the byproducts of the free radical reaction, such as the pyridinic ring reacted with two acetyl radicals.

We further employed IR spectroscopy to analyze the structure change. Figure 3a shows the transmission IR spectra of N-doped graphene, N_Ac, and C_Ac samples, collected by the KBr pellet method. To highlight the spectral change after acetyl group modification, the IR spectrum of N-doped graphene was used as the background. After the background subtraction of N-doped graphene, the N_Ac sample showed a well-defined band at 1631 cm–1. This band is close to that observed in a model molecule 2 (1644 cm–1, Figure 3b) and can be assigned to the vibration of the carbonyl group (C═O). Model molecule 2 has two carbonyl groups, but its transmission IR spectrum shows only one relatively broad peak due to the couple of two carbonyl groups. The IR spectrum of the C_Ac sample, after background subtraction, shows two weak bands at 1607 and 1710 cm–1. The latter may be assigned to C═O of the acetyl group attached on the ortho-carbon of the pyridinic ring, which is close to the model molecule 3 (1694 cm–1). In addition, there is a notable phenomenon that C_Ac has a much weaker carbonyl (or acetyl) group signal than N_Ac. The C_Ac has negligible ORR activity, so that most of ORR active pyridinic N species have been modified by the acetyl group. This result suggests that major pyridinic N species have no open ortho-carbon atoms (that is, connected by another carbon atom), but they can still combine with an acetyl group to form N_Ac; only minor pyridinic N species, which have at least one open ortho-carbon atom and can react with an acetyl free radical to form C_Ac, have ORR activity. The above XPS and IR data demonstrate that N_Ac and C_Ac have the structures as designed (Scheme 1). We also carried out Raman spectroscopic characterization of N-doped graphene, N_Ac, and C_Ac (Figure S6). Modification of the acetyl group on N-doped graphene could introduce some carbon defects and doping.

To get deep insights into the atomistic mechanism of the active sites, we carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations based on supercell models shown in Figure S7. Previous theoretical studies have suggested enhanced reactivity of the C atoms neighboring graphitic N toward ORR intermediates. (27−29) Such effects could be strengthened for pyridinic N because the neighboring C atoms are usually on the edge defects and some irreversible changes might happen during ORR, such as the formation of C═O structure. Generation of the active C═O is shown in Figure 4. In an acidic medium, the pyridinic N can be protonated (Figure 4b), and then, O2 can get chemisorbed on the ortho-C atom (Figure 4c). The chemisorbed O2 gets reduced into OOH (Figure 4d) and finally into C═O (Figure 4e). The C═O could be further protonated to form C═OH+ at low pH. The free energy profile for these processes is illustrated in Figure 4g. The protonation of pyridinic N is a critical step; otherwise, O2 chemisorption cannot occur without this step (Figure S8).

According to previous studies of pH dependence on ORR activity for metal surfaces and carbon-based materials, (30−32) in alkaline media, the first electron could be easily transferred into O2 at the outer Helmholtz plane over a long range. Thus, the gas-phase O2 can be directly reduced into adsorbed OOH. (33) While this process cannot occur in acidic solution, O2 chemisorption is a necessity to transfer electrons into O2. (34) Thus, the O2 absorbability is a proper indicator to screen out the possible active sites in this study. We then build four models corresponding to the pristine and N-doped graphene, as well as N_Ac and C_Ac (Figure 5a), to compare the O2 absorbability. The pyridinic N and the C═O in the ortho position of the pyridinic ring are all protonated due to the low pH value (0.1 M H2SO4).
Figure 5
Figure 5. (a) Models used for the DFT calculation; (b) free energy profiles for the ORR on different configurations; (c) energy change when O2 approaches the active sites.
Figure 5b plots the ORR free energy profiles on the four models, and step a → b is the chemisorption of O2. For pristine graphene and C_Ac, O2 adsorption is endothermic, indicating the difficulty in transferring the first electron into O2 and therefore the low ORR activity. For N_Ac, the O2 adsorption becomes exothermic, suggesting possible ORR activity. On the N-doped graphene, the O2 molecule is even spontaneously converted into the adsorbed OOH by taking the proton from the protonated carbonyl group. Furthermore, the energy barrier calculation shows that O2 chemisorption on the N-doped graphene and N_Ac is barrierless (Figure 5c). To further examine the ORR activity of these two configurations, subsequent ORR steps are modeled as plotted in steps b → f of Figure 5b. During ORR, the free energy drops continually from O2(g) all the way to H2O, and the profiles are close to the theoretical ideal diagram (green dotted line) with equal free energy drops for every step. The theoretical onset potentials calculated from the minimum free energy drop in Figure 5b are 0.60 and 0.59 V vs RHE for pyridinic N and N_Ac, respectively, which are comparable to the experimental results in Figure 1c. All of the optimized configurations used for the free energy calculations are plotted in Figure S9.
To understand the distinct ORR activity between N_Ac and C_Ac, the charge and spin density distributions were calculated and are illustrated in Figure S10. As known, the ground-state O2 molecule is triplet, which will induce a spin-mismatch with sp2 carbon to prevent them from approaching each other. (34) Spin localization can lessen this situation and promote O2 adsorption. Meanwhile, a positively charged site is also favorable for O2 adsorption due to the negatively charged O2 upon reduction. (35) When the acetyl group is attached to pyridinic N, the ortho-C atom simultaneously carries positive charge (0.42 e) and high spin density (the large lobe around the C atom in Figure S10), which is perfect for O2 adsorption. When the ortho-C atom is attached by the acetyl group, its positive charge is greatly reduced to 0.11 e, and the O2 absorbability is lost. A similar effect of the spin and charge density on the ORR activity has also been observed for the defective carbon and S-doped graphene. (36,37) Therefore, the ortho-C atom of the pyridinic ring is the active structure of N-doped carbon for ORR in acidic solution, on which O2 can get adsorbed and reduced favorably.
In conclusion, we present a new approach to reveal the reactive site of N-doped graphene for ORR by site-selective modification of the acetyl group at pyridinic N and ortho-C atoms of the pyridinic ring. The complete inactivity for ORR when the ortho-C atom is blocked indicates that the ortho-C atom of the pyridinic ring is the reactive site for ORR. DFT calculation revealed that the distinct ORR activity between N_Ac and C_Ac mainly comes from the difference in positive charge density and spin density at the ortho-C atom. This study provides new insight into the chemical nature and ORR mechanism on N-doped carbon materials and may help to guide the rational design of high-performance carbon-based ORR electrocatalysts.
