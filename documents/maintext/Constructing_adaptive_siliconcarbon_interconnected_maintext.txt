Nano-silicon (n-Si)/graphite anodes are highly desirable for high-energy lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, the high surface energy of n-Si grains is prone to causing serious agglomeration. In this work, the modified n-Si is evenly dispersed on the g-C3N4 carbon mesh that acquired through melamine heat treatment constructing an adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network structure (mSi50/g-C3N4). Ideally, the mSi50/g-C3N4 composite can be well dispersed and fill the gaps in graphite through traditional ball milling processes. The obtained mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composite prevents the accumulation of Si grains which is beneficial for expediting ion transport, improving conductivity and structural stability. As a result, this anode provides a reversible capacity of 621 mAh⋅g−1 at 0.2 C, with high-capacity retention of 93.3 % after 300 cycles at 1 C and low volume expansion of only 28.6 %. Furthermore, it also maintains excellent cycling stability in full batteries with LiFePO4 cathode. Therefore, constructing the mSi50/g-C3N4 network is an effective strategy to achieve uniform dispersion of Si in graphite and promote larger scale industrialization of n-Si/graphite anode.
The adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network structure was achieved, which is dedicated to the uniform dispersion of Si on the surface of graphite.

Silicon (Si) is regarded as the most promising anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to its high capacity (4200 mAh⋅g−1), abundant reserves, environmental friendliness, and low discharge plateau [
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
]. However, Si suffers from fatal problems such as dramatic volume expansion (≥300 %) during dis/charge, severe particle pulverization, thicker solid electrolyte (SEI) films, and low electrical conductivity [
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
]. Therefore, Si is usually added in small amounts to commercial graphite forming the Si/graphite (Si/Gr) composite in order to improve the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LIBs [
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
].
According to the literature [
7
,
13
], Si nanoization is an effective way to mitigate the volume expansion. Nevertheless, the high surface energy of nano-Si (n-Si) crystals are prone to causing a large amount of agglomeration [
4
,
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
]. Therefore, it is difficult for the n-Si and micrometer sized graphite to form uniformly dispersed Si/Gr composite. In response to overcome the agglomeration problem of n-Si, the investigators have proposed the following two strategies. To begin with, the addition of surfactant is a commonly used strategy [
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
]. It could form spatial site resistance and reduce the surface energy of Si, which in turn inhibits the agglomeration of n-Si. Thus, the modified Si granules obtained can be well distributed in the graphite. Wang et al. [
20
] adsorbed positively charged poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) on the surface of negatively charged Si grains. Then it was compounded with the prepared phenolic resin phase. However, this method does not significantly improve the dispersion. Another tactic is to graft functional groups (-OH, –COOH, –NH2) on the surface of Si [
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
]. Through the interaction force generated between the chemical bonds, the Si to Si can form a stress support and thereby mitigate the aggregation of Si grains. Shi et al. [
24
] utilized coupling agents to modification of pre-existing –OH grafted Si to Si–NH2. Despite the improved dispersion of the m-RWSi@PMMA-C composites obtained, there are many side reactions and thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films, which affects the electrochemical performance of the battery. Hence, it is essential to design a simple and effective strategy to enhance the dispersion of Si and fabricate structurally stable Si/Gr anode materials.
Inspired by the grafting of functional group, in this work, adaptive Si-carbon network structures are constructed by aqueous-solvent interaction of g-C3N4 on modified n-Si obtained by melamine heat treatment. After that, the g-C3N4 modified n-Si can be perfectly filled in the graphite voids via a ball milling process, thus forming mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composite. The resulting mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr can realize the homogeneous dispersion of silicon particles in the whole carbon materials, thus favoring ion transport, stress dispersion, and structural stability.
The chemical reagents and drugs involved in this work are all analytical grade and do not require further processing. Nano silicon (50 nm) was purchased from Ningbo Yumu New Materials Co., Ltd. The graphite is provided by Hebei Kuntian New Energy Co., LTD. Sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Sinopharm Group. Melamine, urea, perylene 3,4,9,10 dicarboxylic anhydride, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) micro powder, and 3-aminopropyltriethoxy-silane (kh550) drugs were purchased on Aladdin.
5 g of melamine was placed in a muffle furnace and heated to 550 °C at a rate of 2 °C⋅min−1. After 5 h of insulation, approximately 2.46 g of g-C3N4 sample was acquired. 2 g of n-Si was added to 20 ml of H2SO4 and H2O2 (1:1) solution. Stir the suspension on a magnetic stirrer (550 r⋅min−1) at room temperature for 30 min, filter it 5–6 times with deionized water (DI), and dry it at 60 °C for 8 h to obtain n-Si particles with hydroxyl groups. Then it and 2 ml kh550 were added to 100 ml DI with magnetic stirring for 2 h. DI filter 5–6 times and dry overnight in 60 °C oven. The result is a silicon particle (mSi50) containing an amino group. g-C3N4 (0.2 g) was dissolved in 150 ml DI. mSi50 (0.2 g) was dispersed in 50 ml of alcohol and sonicated for 30 min. Titrate mSi50 uniformly into g-C3N4 solution and stir for 8 h. Filter and dry to obtain mSi50/g-C3N4. Then mSi50/g-C3N4 and PTFE micro-powder (0.4 g) were ball milled at 150 r⋅min−1 for 30 min. Add graphite (1.2 g) back into the ball milling tank and ball mill for 1 h at a rate of 200 r⋅min−1. The obtained composite material was transferred to a tube furnace filled with argon gas and heated to 700 °C for 2 h at a temperature of 2 °C⋅min−1. Finally, mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr was acquired.
Preparation of the pSi50/Gr: 0.2 g of pure Si and 0.4 g of PTFE micro-powder were milled at 150 r⋅min−1 for 30 min in a ball milling jar. Then, 1.2 g of graphite was added to the ball milling jar, and further milled at 200 r⋅min−1 for 2 h. Finally, the above mixture was transferred to a tube furnace and heated to 700 °C at a rate of 2 °C⋅min−1 under an argon atmosphere for 2 h to obtain the pSi50/Gr sample.
The preparation method of mSi50/Gr is the same as pSi50/Gr, except that the pure Si raw material used is changed to mSi50.
The morphology and structure of pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr, and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composites were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi SU8010) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Talos F200S). The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) used a powder diffractometer (Rigaku D/max-2400), where the target material was Cu Kα Radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å), the 2θ step was 0.04°. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was recorded with a spectrometer (FT-IR, PerkinElmer Spectrum One, USA) at room temperature. The valence distribution and chemical bond composition of mSi50/Gr and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composites were recorded by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250xi). Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET, SSA-7000 analyzer) determined the specific surface area and pore size distribution of pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composites. Element mapping was used to analyze the distribution of elements contained in mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composite.
The electrodes were constructed from the active material, carbon black and sodium alginate, with a 8 : 1: 1 mass ratio. After adding an appropriate amount of DI, the ground paint was coated on the copper foil and dried overnight in a vacuum drying oven at 80 °C. The battery box, electrolyte, lithium sheet, polypropylene diaphragm (Cellgard 2400) and electrode sheet were assembled into a half battery (CR2032) in a professional battery glove box of high-purity argon. The electrolyte consisted of 1 % LiPO2F2, 2 % N, N-dimethyl trifluoroacetamide (DMTFA), 1 % trimethyl-silane borate (TMSB), 13 % LiPF6, 0.5 % ethyl sulfate (DTD) and 82.5 % ethylene carbonate (EC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC), ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) (volume ratio1:1:1). The LAND-CT2001A half-cell was tested voltage in 0.005–2 V. Electrochemical workstation (CHI660D) tested cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance (EIS). The scan speed was set at 0.1–5 mV s−1, and the frequency range was 0.01–105 Hz.
The full cell was assembled with mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr as the anode and LiFePO4 (Ganrd co., Ltd) as the cathode (N/P ratio of 1.2). The electrolyte was commercial 1 M LiPF6 in 94 % diethyl carbonate (DEC), EC, EMC (volume ratio1:1:1), 5 % fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) and 1 % vinyl carbonate (VC). The electrochemical performance was tested on a LAND CT2001A with a voltage window of 2.2–4 V.
Fig. 1
briefly displays the preparation process of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample. First, the n-Si was grafted into Si–OH. Subsequently, the Si–OH was modified by kh550 to obtain the aminated Si–NH2. On the other hand, the conductive carbon mesh (g-C3N4) was obtained by high temperature heat treatment of melamine. After the above steps, before adding Si–NH2 into the g-C3N4 solution, the g-C3N4 was dissolved in DI. Then, the adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network structure was acquired. Finally, the Si-carbon interconnection network was combined with graphite by high-energy ball milling technology, so that the Si-carbon interconnection network can perfectly fill the graphite gap.
Fig. 1. Schematic of mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr preparation.
In order to observe the morphology and structure of the prepared composite materials, SEM and TEM are used [
[25]
,
[26]
,
[27]
].
Fig. 2
a, b and c represent the SEM images of the pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr, and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composites, respectively. The Si granules in the pSi50/Gr composite materials exhibit significant agglomeration, along with varying particle sizes (
Fig. 2
a). However, there is no large agglomeration of Si particles on the surface of the mSi50/Gr composite, indicating the uniform distribution of Si grains in graphite bas been well realized (
Fig. 2
b and
Fig.S1
). As shown in
Fig. 2
c, it is evident that an adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network is successfully constructed on the surface of mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr, which perfectly fills the lacuna in the graphite. The Si granules can be uniformly coated in graphite by forming an adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network. As shown in
Fig. 2
d–f, the TEM results are consistent with those obtained by SEM. To be specific, the agglomeration is serious for the pSi50/Gr sample without modification, while the dispersion of Si particles can be realized simply after modification. As a result, the constructed adaptive interconnection network is uniformly coated in graphite for the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample. The (111) and (220) crystal planes [
28
] of Si in mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr can be observed by selective electron diffraction in the inset of
Fig. 2
f, which proves the existence of Si. HRTEM shows that the crystal plane spacing of Si (111) and graphite (002) is 0.311 nm and 0.335 nm, respectively (
Fig. 2
g). The energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping results reflect the uniform distribution of C, Si, O and N elements in the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composite (
Fig. 2
h-l).

(a–c) SEM images of the pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr, mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composites, respectively; (d–f) TEM images of the pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr (contains a SAED pattern), respectively; (g) HRTEM images of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr; (h–l) EDS mapping images of the C, Si, O, N in mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composite.
Fig. 3
a shows the XRD patterns of the pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr, and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr samples. Obviously, the three composites show similar phase structure. The sharp characteristic peaks at 28.4°, 47.3°, and 56.1° correspond to the diffraction peaks of Si (111), (220), and (311) crystal planes (PDF # 27–1402) [
4
,
29
]. In addition, there is a strong diffraction peak at 26°, which corresponds to the (002) crystal plane of graphite, manifesting the absence of impurities in the three samples. As shown in
Fig. 3
b, the wavenumber at 3864 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectra belongs to the N–H bending vibration. The mSi50/Gr composite material exhibits an obvious N–H bending vibration, which is disappeared in the FT-IR spectrum of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample. This phenomenon suggests that the NH2 in Si–NH2 is unstable in aqueous solution, prompting the free Si to combine with the chemical bond in g-C3N4 to form a stable chemical bond. The mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample showed a strong bending vibration peak at 1213 cm−1, indicating that g-C3N4 provided a mass of C–N bonds. The peak located at 678 cm−1 belongs to the Si–O tensile vibration [
30
,
31
]. This Si–O tensile vibration peak in mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr is not obvious, possibly due to the instability of Si–O bonds at high temperatures. In
Fig. 3
c, the specific surface areas of the pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr, and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr samples are 17.69, 15.05, and 10.08 m2 g−1, respectively. It is worth noting that the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample delivers a lower specific surface area and is less susceptible to aggregation due to the repulsive effect of surface adsorbents. This demonstrates that the constructed adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network can be uniformly coated in graphite and forms a whole with graphite. The pore size of the three samples is approximately 4 nm (
Fig.S2
), suggesting that the introduction of g-C3N4 does not affect the pore size.

The XPS technology was used to analyze the elemental and valence state compositions of the mSi50/Gr, and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr samples. The XPS total spectra in
Fig. 3
d clearly imply that there is a significant N 1s signal in the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample, which is consistent with the results analyzed by FT-IR.
Fig. 3
e explains that the C 1s signal of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample can be divided into four peaks: C–C, C–N, C–O, and CO, corresponding to binding energies of 284.76, 285.26, 286.25 and 289.74 eV, respectively [
32
]. The existence of C–N bonds precisely confirms the introduction of g-C3N4. As indicated in
Fig. 3
f, the Si 2p signal of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample can be deconvolved into two different peaks, namely Si–O/Si–N (103.06 eV) and SiOx (103.95 eV) [
3
]. Interestingly, as observed in
Fig.S3
, the binding forms through the Si 2p deconvolution in mSi50/Gr are Si–Si (101.09 eV) and SiOx (105.14 eV) [
33
]. The overall shift of the spectrum in mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr is attributed to the introduction of g-C3N4, which strongly attracts the N element to Si grains, thus forming more stable Si–N bonds. The O 1s signal in the XPS can be deconvolved into three peaks: C–O, O–Si–O, and CO, with corresponding binding energies of 532.11, 532.92 and 533.96 eV, respectively (
Fig. 3
g). As seen in
Fig. 3
h, the N 1s signal can be deconvoluted into four peaks: Si–N (397.98 eV), pyridinic N (399.02 eV), pyrrolic N (400.01 eV), and graphitic N (402.03 eV) [
34
]. The detected Si–N bond is consistent with the results in the XPS spectra of Si 2p. In summary, the addition of g-C3N4 can form a conductive interconnection network with modified Si, ensuring structural stability and accelerating ion transport efficiency.
In order to study the electrochemical performance of the composite materials, they were assembled into half cells to test their Li+ storage performance. As displayed in
Fig. 4
a, the charge/discharge curves at 1 C show that the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr anode shows a lower discharge plateau (0.22–0.48 V), suggesting that the formed interconnected network is beneficial for suppressing the occurrence of side reactions [
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
]. In addition, the charging/discharging capacities in the 2nd, 50th, 100th, and 300th cycles are 422.6/436.7, 447.4/450.3, 439.9/442, 390/391.9 mAh⋅g−1, respectively, manifesting good cycling stability. Although the pSi50/Gr and mSi50/Gr samples also deliver high capacity in the first few cycles, their cycling stability is extremely poor (
Fig.S4-S5
). It is not difficult to find that the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr anode shows excellent rate performance. The stability of performance can be guaranteed at 0.1–1 C, and the capacity can still reach the initial test capacity in the 0.1 C by rebound test (
Fig. 4
b). This is due to the fact that the construction of an adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network can perfectly fill the gaps in graphite, thereby ensuring the stability of the structure. However, the pSi50/Gr and mSi50/Gr sample exhibit poor rate performance. In
Fig. 4
c, the composite materials are subjected to cyclic testing at a low magnification of 0.2 C. The pSi50/Gr and mSi50/Gr anodes exhibited severe capacity degradation in cycling tests, providing reversible capacities/capacity retention of 405.2 mAh⋅g−1/61.4 % and 336.8 mAh⋅g−1/50.5 % after 50 cycles. The reason for their severe cyclic attenuation is the severe aggregation of internal particles, which leads to particle fragmentation and structural collapse during the cycling process. On the other hand, the reversible capacity of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr anode remains at 558.2 mAh⋅g−1, corresponding to 89.8 % capacity retention after 50 cycles, indicating that the formed interconnected network stabilizes the structure, thereby facilitating electrolyte infiltration and expediting ion transport efficiency. The CV test was adopted to study the electrochemical behaviors of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr material (
Fig. 4
d). A wide reduction peak is generated at 0.68 V, which is due to the formation of a stable SEI film on the surface of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr electrode. There are two reduction peaks corresponding to Li+ embedded into the anode at 0.05 and 0.17 V. The two peaks at 0.23 and 0.49 V correspond to the oxidation peaks caused by the extraction of Li+ from graphite and Si, respectively. Moreover, it can be seen that after the peak current intensity changes in the first three cycles, the CV curves almost overlap in the following cycles, which proves the stability of the sample.

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the electrochemical performance, the reaction kinetics of the prepared composite materials were tested by EIS.
Fig. 4
e illustrates the EIS and ion diffusion coefficients results of the pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr, and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr samples. It can be clearly observed that the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr anode exhibits lower solute impedance (Rs) and charge transfer impedance (Rct), compared with those of the pSi50/Gr and mSi50/Gr anodes. The detailed parameter comparison can be found in
Table S1
. According to
Equation S1
formula [
38
,
39
], the ion diffusion coefficient (DLi+) and Warburg factor can be calculated (
Fig. 4
f), where Warburg coefficient (σ) the smaller the value, the better the DLi+. It is not difficult to spot that the DLi+ of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr (σ = 10.43) is much lower than that of the pSi50/Gr (σ = 24.63) and mSi50/Gr (σ = 15.12). The calculation formula for conductivity at room temperature is: σ = L/R (Ω × A), where L is the electrode thickness (cm), σ is the conductivity (s cm−1), A is the surface area (cm−2), and R is the resistivity. According to the EIS measurement calculation in
Table S1
, the conductivity for mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr, pSi50/Gr and mSi50/Gr is 4.5 × 10−4, 3.2 × 10−4 s cm−1, and 3.8 × 10−4 s cm−1, respectively. It can be concluded that the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample has a higher conductivity and faster Li+ migration rate. This indicates that building an adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network is beneficial for reducing the consumption of ions traveling through electrodes and accelerating the efficiency of electron transfer.
Fig. 4
g–i shows the multi turn CV and capacity contribution obtained by calculating the peak area of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr anode. The multi cycle CV curves of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample exhibit likeness shapes at scanning rates of 0.2–5 mV s−1, demonstrating outstanding reversibility for the composite material (
Fig. 4
g). By using
Equation S2
formula [
[40]
,
[41]
,
[42]
], it may be calculated that the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr is dominated by diffusing controlled processes (
Fig. 4
h). The capacitance contribution increases with the increase of scanning rate (
Fig. 4
i), and the higher the capacitance contribution, the higher the ion and electron transfer efficiency. Similarly, we also plotted the multi turn CV and capacitance contributions of the pSi50/Gr (
Fig.S6
) and mSi50/Gr anodes (
Fig.S7
). It can be seen that the pSi50/Gr and mSi50/Gr anodes, like mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr, all have similar shapes at different scanning rates and are dominated by diffusing controlled processes. However, its capacitance contribution is less than that of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr, which is consistent with the EIS results. Then, we further investigate the cycling performance of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr at higher magnification. The initial reversible capacity of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr is 420.3 mAh⋅g−1 at 1 C, and the capacity retention rate is 93.3 % after 300 cycles (
Fig. 4
j). However, although the pSi50/Gr and mSi50/Gr anodes can deliver higher reversible capacity (555.5 mAh⋅g−1 and 523.6 mAh⋅g−1, respectively), their cyclic damping is grave, with capacity retention rates of 51.3 % and 56.1 % after 300 cycles, respectively. In contrast, the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr sample exhibits excellent cycling constancy, thanking to its lower specific surface area, high conductivity, fast ion transport efficiency, and interconnected network structure. So as to compare the modification effects of conductive carbon networks in various carbon materials, we also prepared carbon networks by urea and perylene 3,4,9,10 tetracarboxylic anhydride. These carbon networks also show significant improvement effects, indicating the universality of this method. For detailed instructions, please refer to
Fig.S8-13
and
Table S2
.
To further verify the stable structure of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr electrode, we conducted cross-sectional SEM tests on the volume expansion of the sample before and after cycling (
Fig. 5
a–f) [
13
,
43
]. For the initial state that after three cycles, the average thicknesses for the pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr electrodes are 16, 15 and 14 μm, respectively. The cross-sections of the three electrodes exhibit a smooth and flat feature. After 100 cycles, there is a significant difference in the thickness variation of the three electrodes. The average thicknesses and expansion rate for the pSi50/Gr, mSi50/Gr and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr electrodes are 25 μm/56.3 %, 27 μm/80.0 % and 18 μm/28.6 %, respectively. It can be seen that the expansion rate of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr electrode is significantly lower compared to other electrodes. Moreover, the cross-section of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr electrode appears more compact and complete. This can be more clearly seen through the SEM images of the electrode surface. As shown in
Fig.S14
, after 100 cycles, there are obvious cracks in the pSi50/Gr and mSi50/Gr electrodes, while the surface of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr electrode remained flat as before. Especially for the pSi50/Gr electrode, the entire active materials have split, indicating that they will soon detach from the current collector. The appearance of cracks reflects a very high stress inside the electrode. This stress mainly originates from the volume change of the Si particles during the charging and discharging process. The cracking degree of the mSi50/Gr electrode is significantly reduced compared to that of the pSi50/Gr electrode, indicating that the dispersion of Si in the mSi50/Gr electrode is more uniform. Therefore, the stress generated by the volume change of Si can't be concentrated in a certain location. The structure of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr electrode remains the most complete, indicating that the Si-carbon interconnection network can effectively alleviate volume effects and disperse internal stress. For the pSi50/Gr and mSi50/Gr electrodes with poor dispersion, the schematic diagram of the electrode change process is presented in
Fig. 5
g. Differently, due to the introduction of g-C3N4, a stable Si-carbon interconnection network is formed during the Li+ de-lithiation process, which firmly binds Si particles to the carbon network. After multiple cycles, the Si particles undergo slight expansion with no electrode breakage occurring, thus ensuring the stability and high conductivity (

The adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network constructed by mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composite material has outstanding electrochemical performance, making it widely applicable. A coin-shaped full battery is assembled using commercial lithium iron phosphate (LFP) as cathode and mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr as anode (
Fig. 6
a). The anode to cathode capacity ratio of the assembled full battery is about 1.2 [

]. The assembled full battery has a stable static voltage at 0.2 C (1 C = 170 mAh⋅g−1) (
Fig.S15
). After the battery is fully charged, it can easily light up the “HEBUST” consisting of 67 small light bulbs (

b). In addition, the reversible capacity can reach 136 mAh⋅g−1 over the voltage range of 2.2–4 V (based on the quality of the cathode active substance) [

]. Compared with the recently reported Si/Gr//LFP full battery (

), this assembled full battery can supply an ultra-high energy density of 470 Wh⋅kg−1 (calculation formula can be found in
Equation S3
) [

c, the charge/discharge curves of the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr//LFP full cell at different cycles after activation at 1 C almost overlap, suggesting that the cycling performance gradually stabilizes after activation.

d illustrates the performance testing of the full battery during the cycling process. After 60 cycles after being fully charged, the reversible capacity still remains at 120 mAh⋅g−1, corresponding to a capacity retention rate of 96 %. These merit electrochemical properties can enable the widespread application of mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr in some energy storage devices.

In summary, aminated n-Si combines with the g-C3N4 carbon mesh that acquired through melamine heat treatment constructing an adaptive Si-carbon interconnection network structure. The constructed Si–N and C–N bonds can effectively bind Si grains to the carbon mesh. Resultingly, the obtained mSi50/g-C3N4 composite can be well dispersed and fill the gaps in graphite after compounding with graphite. The final mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr composite achieves uniform distribution of Si particles in the graphite, which is beneficial for accelerating ion transfer efficiency, enhancing stress dispersion and structural stability, thus enabling outstanding electrochemical performance. The electrochemical test results indicate that this anode material can provide a reversible capacity of 621 mAh⋅g−1 at 0.2 C, with a high-capacity retention rate of 93.3 % after 300 cycles at 1 C. What's more, in the mSi50/g-C3N4/Gr//LFP full battery test, the cell still exhibits a capacity retention rate of 96 % after 60 cycles at 1 C. Hence, this research provides a new insight into the preparation of highly dispersed Si/Gr composite materials.
