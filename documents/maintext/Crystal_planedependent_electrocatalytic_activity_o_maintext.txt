First report of crystal plane effect of Co3O4 on electrocatalytic water oxidation
The {110} plane of Co3O4 is more active for OER catalysis than {100}.
In alkaline electrolytes, Co3 + is the active sites of Co3O4 for OER.
Crystalline structure and surface features of metal oxide catalyst have important influence on catalysis, however, no research work has focused on the relationship between the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity and plane effect of Co3O4 nanocrystals. In this work, Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes with different dominant exposed nanocrystalline planes ({110} and {100}) were synthesized to investigate the plane effects of Co3O4 nanocrystalline on the OER activity. Results show that the surface Co3 + species of the Co3O4 crystal should be the active sites for OER catalysis.
Co3O4 nanorods with different dominantly exposed {110} planes show better OER activity than nanocubes with mainly exposed {100} planes which show the plane effects of Co3O4 nanocrystalline on the OER activity.

. In particular, rapid development in synthetic methodologies makes it possible to prepare metal oxide crystals with controlled shape, size and morphology, therefore offering a good opportunity to gain basic knowledge of their crystalline structure related catalytic performance. For instance, α-iron (III) oxide (α-Fe2O3) quasicubics, cerium (IV) oxide (CeO2) nanorods and magnesium oxide (MgO) hexagonal crystals have been synthesized and their significant catalytic activity has been proven to be closely associated with their large number of active centers located at specific crystal facets

[10]
. As such, it is scientifically meaningful to investigate the crystal facet-dependent activity of metal oxides due to their practically useful applications in a variety of fields.
Among those metal oxides, tricobalt tetraoxide (Co3O4) has been widely investigated as an important functional material in a variety of electrochemical

. Specifically, few efforts have been devoted to understanding the crystalline structural related activity of Co3O4 in heterogeneous catalysis. Shen et al. reported that nanorod-shaped Co3O4 with predominantly exposed {110} planes shows a surprisingly high catalytic property for CO oxidation attributing it to the abundance of active Co3 + cations on (110) planes
[5]
. Similarly, Hao's group found that the {110} planes of Co3O4 are responsible for high catalytic performance toward ethylene oxidation
[16]
. In addition, Li and co-workers observed apparently higher turnover frequency of {011} planes (Co3O4 nanobelts) than that of {001} planes (Co3O4 nanocubes)
[15]
,
[17]
. Very recently, Xiao et al. compared nanocrystalline Co3O4 with specific facets of {110}, {100}, and {111} for their performance toward electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction 
[18]
. Meanwhile, Wang's group reported the effect of crystal planes of Co3O4 nanocrystals on the performance of Li–O2 batteries, revealing a significantly reduced discharge–charge overpotential
[19]
. In recent years, thriving efforts in developing water splitting technology, which converts solar energy or electricity into molecular hydrogen in an environmentally benign way, have vigorously motivated research activities toward the development of stable and highly efficient electrocatalysts for water oxidation, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)

[23]
. Particular attention has been paid to Co3O4, which has been demonstrated to be an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution over the past decades
[24]

[25]

[26]
. However, to the best of our knowledge, the previous work on Co3O4 for OER has been largely focused on developing synthetic methodologies, controlling shape, tuning morphology, designing nanostructured architecture, and incorporation of Co3O4 into conductive matrices, such as metal supports and carbon materials

. Although these results were richly reported, unfortunately, no study is available on plane-dependent electrocatalytic water oxidation properties of crystalline Co3O4. Nevertheless, it is extremely necessary to make a systematical insight into the plane-dependent activity of Co3O4 toward OER, especially considering that it plays a crucial role in water splitting technology, as well as in other energy storage and conversion applications.
Herein, we report the preparation of Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes which were comprised mainly of exposed {110} and {100} facets, respectively. Based on the well characterized crystalline structure and surface features, the facet-dependent electrocatalytic activity toward OER was carefully investigated. In alkaline solutions, the Co3O4 nanorods with preferentially exposed {110} facets exhibit apparently higher electrocatalytic OER activity than Co3O4 nanocubes with mainly exposed {100} facets. This work not only contributes to understanding the mechanism of OER activity for cobalt based components, but also helps to design and synthesize highly efficient electrocatalysts for renewable energy storage and conversion applications.
We have synthesized Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes via simple hydrothermal strategies according to the previously published procedure with some modification, and concrete details for experimental section are shown in supporting information

[31]
. The TEM image in

Figs. 1

To further confirm the formation of Co3O4, the Co3O4 was crystallographically characterized by their X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern. As shown in Fig. 2S, the recorded XRD spectrum of both Co3O4 nanorod and nanocube shows several characteristic peaks indexed as (111) (220) (311) (222) (400) (511) (440), which correspond to typical pure spinel Co3O4 face-centered cubic phase (JCPDS card No. 43-1003). We noted that the preferential facet was not displayed as discerned from the XRD, and this observation is in accordance with the reported results

. However, as usually reported in above literatures, predominant crystalline planes and the exposed planes could be indicated by HRTEM.
Fig. 2
shows typical HRTEM images of the Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes.
Fig. 2
a shows a section of the Co3O4 nanorod observed in the [001] orientation, where two orthogonal sets were observed, with lattice spacings around 0.278 nm and 0.279 nm corresponding to {220} for Co3O4. The corresponding HRTEM images (
Fig. 2
b) indicate that the lattice spacings are around 0.250 nm and 0.283 nm, which are in good accordance with the standard data of {113} and {220} planes. In addition, it is known that the normal directions perpendicular to the surfaces can be indexed as[1 - 1 0]. As shown in
Fig. 2
c, the predominantly exposed planes of Co3O4 nanocubes are {001}, which are the only planes normal to the set of (220) planes with a lattice spacing of 0.278 nm. Based on the HRTEM results, we present a cartoon picture to illustrate

To assess their OER catalytic activity, the samples were loaded onto glassy carbon RDE electrodes with equal mass loading. The ohmic potential drop (iR) losses that arise from the solution resistance were all corrected (Fig. S3). For two samples, a series of electrochemical experiments were performed under the same conditions. As shown in
Fig. 3
a, the polarization curves showed that the OER onset potential of Co3O4 nanorods was about 470 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M KOH with an overpotential only 265 mV (E°H2O/O2 = 205.6 mV at pH 14), which is much more positive than that of the Co3O4 nanocubes (
Fig. 3
a, Table S1). Meanwhile, the catalytic current of Co3O4 nanorods is apparently higher than that of Co3O4 nanocubes. For comparison, no obvious current response was observed for the bare RDE electrode (
Fig. 3
a). Meanwhile, as a meaningful data, the overpotential of achieving a current density j = 10 mA cm− 2 for Co3O4 nanorods is 353 mV, which is much smaller than that of Co3O4 nanocubes (
Fig. 3
a, Table S1). Also, we noted that the polarization curves of Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes in 0.1 M KOH (
Fig. 3
d) show nearly the same conclusion as in 1 M KOH (
Fig. 3
a).

(b) Tafel plot derived from (a) (η = Eapp − E°H2O/O2). (c) Galvanostatic OER profiles on RDE at j = 20 mA cm− 2 of Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes in 1 M KOH. (d) Polarization curves of Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes on RDE at 1 mV s− 1 in 0.1 M KOH (after iR compensation). Experimental conditions: T = 298 K, glassy carbon electrodes of RDE at 2000 rpm, the j (mA cm− 2) is normalized by geometric area of the glassy carbon electrode.
The OER kinetics of the above catalysts were further evaluated by measuring the Tafel plots (log j ~ η), as shown in
Fig. 3
b. The resulting Tafel slopes are found to be about 62 and 65 mV dec− 1 for Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes, respectively. The smaller Tafel slope of Co3O4 nanorods indicates that Co3O4 nanorods are more efficient than Co3O4 nanocubes as OER electrocatalysts.
The above data shows that the as synthesized Co3O4 nanorods have better OER voltammetric response than the Co3O4 nanocubes. To convincingly confirm that {110}, which is the predominantly exposed specific facet of the nanorod, is more advantageous to OER than {100} of the nanocube, we further assess the crystal plane effect toward OER catalysis. The specific activity values jsa (mA cm− 2) were calculated by normalizing the current density with the BET surface area (SBET m2 g− 1, Fig. S4, calculation in supporting information), versus potential (vs. Ag/AgCl), as shown in Fig. S5. It implies that the specific activity of Co3O4 nanorods is still higher than that of Co3O4 nanocubes either in 1 M KOH or 0.1 M KOH. This result demonstrates that the {110} crystal plane of Co3O4 is much active than {100} plane.
To clearly understand the origination of the OER activity of the samples,
Fig. 4
presents the surface atomic configurations of the planes, implying that in the Co3O4 crystal structure, the {100} planes contain only Co2 + cations, while the {110} plane is composed mainly of Co3 + cations. This scenario has also been proved by surface differential diffraction studies, which illustrate that the Co3 + cations are present solely on the {110} plane
[34]
,
[35]
. As reported, Co3 + cations were regarded as the most active sites for ethylene oxidation
[16]
and CO oxidation
[5]
,
[17]
,
[18]
,
[31]
, whereas the surface Co2 + ions on {100} can effectively catalyze oxygen reduction reaction 
[18]
. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that the Co3O4 nanorods, with predominantly exposed {110} planes, which are composed of rich Co3 + species, should possess better OER activity than Co3O4 nanocubes, whose {100} planes are composed of Co2 + only. It suggests that the surface Co3 + cations of the Co3O4 crystal are the mainly catalytical active sites for OER. Notably, this point is strongly supported by the turnover frequency (TOF) results, where the TOF of Co3O4 nanorods at η of 500 mV is much higher than that of Co3O4 nanocubes, as shown in Table S1.
Fig. 4. Spinel structure of Co3O4 crystal and the surface atomic configurations in the {110} (a) and {001} (b) planes, respectively.
Apart from high OER activity, the stability test for OER catalysis is another critical parameter for evaluating the practicability of the catalysts. We recorded the galvanostatic curves for both Co3O4 nanorods and Co3O4 nanocubes for over 9000 s under alkaline conditions, as shown in
Fig. 3
c. Only a slight change of the potential for Co3O4 nanorods was observed, while apparent deviation of the potential for Co3O4 nanocubes was found, suggesting better alkaline tolerance of Co3O4 nanorods than that of Co3O4 nanocubes.
Gas chromatography was further carried out to identify the product at the anode chamber during OER tests (Fig. S6). It shows that, along with the proceeding of electrolysis at 0.8 V, the produced amount of O2 at both Co3O4 nanorods and nanocube anodes was increased. At same condition, the produced amount of O2 at anode of Co3O4 nanorods is apparently larger than that of Co3O4 nanocubes.
Further insight into the kinetics of catalytic reactions was examined with the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique (
Fig. 5
a). The charge transfer resistance (Rct) calculated for Co3O4 nanorods is ca. 4.5 Ω, which is smaller than that of Co3O4 nanocubes (about 8.6 Ω), suggesting the higher charge transport efficiency of the Co3O4 nanorod electrode whose surface cations are mainly Co3 + species. Such differences of charge transport efficiency between Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes should be closely associated with the performance for OER catalysis. A carton picture was presented to understand the OER performance of the nanorods and nanocubes, as illustrated in
Fig. 5

In summary, we have successfully synthesized Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes revealing well-defined crystal structures. A variety of parameters, including current, jsa, TOF, and Rct were used to characterize the crystal plane effect of Co3O4 nanorods and nanocubes on their OER activity. Compared with Co3O4 nanocubes, the Co3O4 nanorods exhibited superior catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes. Further analysis of the specific activity values jsa (mA cm− 2) suggested that the {110} plane is more active to OER catalysis than {100}. We demonstrate that the surface containing Co3 + species of Co3O4 crystals should be responsible for the catalytically activity for OER. This work not only provides insights into the plane effect of Co3O4 crystal on OER, but also paves a way of controlling morphology and structure of metal oxides for developing high performance OER electrocatalysts.
