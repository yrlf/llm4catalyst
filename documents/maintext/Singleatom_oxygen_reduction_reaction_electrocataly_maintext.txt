{'Abstract': 'The development of non Pt-based catalysts (non-PBCs) that show excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity for high-performance Zn–air battery (ZAB) and anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) is highly necessitated. Here, the unprecedented single-atom ORR activity of Fe, Si, and N co-doped carbon (FeSiNC) supported on 3D interconnected mesoporous carbons (25 and 50 nm) derived from silica templates is reported. Si moieties connected to a carbon surface were involved in the formation of an atomically distributed FeSixN4−x site through substitution of Si at the N position in the Fe–N4 site, which is the ORR active site of the conventional FeNC. FeSiNC with its larger mesopore (50 nm) exhibits outstanding ORR activity comparable to the most efficient non-Pt-based catalysts and enhanced single-cell performances due to its enhanced mass-transport property. According to theoretical calculations, the ORR activity is originated from not only FeSixN4−x sites located at the basal plane and inter-edge sites, but also C sites adjacent to the Si dopant in both edge and basal regions. Therefore, this study provides a facile strategy toward the rational design of inexpensive and highly active ORR catalysts applicable to single-cell devices.', '1. Introduction': 'The ORR activity of M–N sites was first reported by Jasinski et al., who demonstrated that Co-phthalocyanine exhibits ORR activity under alkaline conditions.13 Since then, numerous efforts have thus been devoted to synthesizing ORR active M–N sites within a carbon support for enhanced ORR activity and stability via the structural integrity of MNC.14–18 For FeNC electrocatalysts that present outstanding ORR activity, the origin of their ORR activity has been identified as the Fe in-plane coordinated with four pyridinic nitrogens (Fe–N4) located at edges and steps within the micropores of the graphitic carbon surface.7,9,14,16 It has been reported that the ORR activity of FeNC increases with the micropore surface area, where the catalytic sites are located. Therefore, significant efforts have been focused on developing microporous structures containing ORR active Fe–N4 sites.7,9,14,16\nIn addition, single-atom catalysts (SACs) for ORR applications have recently been highlighted due to their maximum atom-utilization efficiency and unique properties for excellent catalytic performance, and the possibility for the direct modulation of the active catalytic center for enhanced performance.19–22 For example, the electronic density of the Co atom catalyst has been modified by regulating the atomic configuration via modulation of the types of coordination atoms, in which Co-N3PS presented outstanding ORR activity. In addition, the influence of N-doping on the catalytic activity of the single Cu catalyst has been reported.23 Therefore, designing SACs with an appropriate chemical environment for enhancing the ORR activity is an important issue.\nRecently, additional doping on FeNC has been considerably attempted because the incorporation of an additional dopant, such as B and S, located near Fe–N4 sites is known to lower the electron delocalization around the catalytic center. This improves the interaction with oxygen species, and thus significantly reduces the energy barrier of ORR.24–28 In particular, many research efforts have focused on the development of S co-doped FeNCs (FeSNCs) because S-containing precursors are readily available, and efficient S doping on the carbon framework can be attained.25–28 However, dopant candidates are limited and the direct modulation of the Fe–N4 catalytic site has rarely been achieved.\nMeanwhile, FeNC electrocatalysts exhibit outstanding ORR activity under alkaline conditions compared to acidic conditions.14,15,24,27,28 Therefore, ZABs and AEMFCs based on alkaline media have been of significant research interests. It is known that the cathode catalyst loading in AEMFCs is usually 5–20 times larger than proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In addition, a relatively thick cathode layer is generally required for non-PBCs due to their comparatively low density and ORR activity compared to PBCs, which can cause serious mass-transport issues.29–31 Thus, the mass-transport of reactants and products should be considered as important as the ORR activity, especially under an alkaline-based full-cell configuration.29–31 There have been several reports demonstrating that the hierarchical pore structured non-PBCs show improved ORR activity and single-cell performance due to enhanced mass-transport and facile access to their catalytic sites. For example, the Sung and Hyeon groups have recently reported how to optimize multimodal porous structures to improve their ORR activity and single-cell performance.32 Lee et al. reported that controlling the pore size and doping-site position is directly correlated with the ORR activity and single-cell performance.33 However, excellent single-cell performance due to a synergistic combination of superior ORR catalysts as an alternative to PBCs and effectually facilitated mass-transport through 3D interconnected large mesopores still remains a challenge.\nHerein, we demonstrate a facile strategy to produce Fe, Si, and N co-doped carbon (FeSiNC) supported on 3D interconnected mesoporous carbons (3DMCs) with large mesopores (25 and 50 nm) that were dictated by colloidal silica crystal templates. Si moieties chemically bonded to the carbon surface were involved in the formation of atomically distributed FeSixN4−x sites through the substitution of Si at the N position in the Fe–N4 sites. The ORR activity of the FeSiNC catalysts was judiciously evaluated. It was found that FeSiNC with larger mesopores (50 nm, FeSiNC_50a) exhibits excellent ORR activity comparable to the most efficient non-PBCs to date, and presents superior single-cell performances in ZAB and AEMFC compared to those of FeSiNC with smaller mesopores (25 nm, FeSiNC_25a). In addition, it featured increasing catalyst loadings due to an effectually facilitated mass-transport property through the 3D interconnected larger mesopore.\nThe origin of the ORR activity of FeSiNC was revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It showed that the most active ORR site of FeSiNC is Fe coordinated to Si and Ns located at the basal plane, in which the inter-edge site also presents outstanding ORR activity. More importantly, the C sites adjacent to the Si dopant in both edge and basal regions of FeSiNC show outstanding ORR activity, whereas the conventional FeNC presents no ORR activity on the C sites. When considering the limited candidates for an additional dopant on the conventional FeNC for enhanced ORR activity and rarely reported direct modulation of the FeNC site, this finding could open a new venue for developing cost-effective, durable, and highly active ORR catalysts with a high catalytic-site density, which can be practically used in ZAB and AEMFC devices.', '2.

Results and discussion': 'Synthesis and characterization of FeSiNC\nThe textural features of the 3DMCs were measured using the nitrogen sorption isotherms so that moderate and abrupt uptakes at a very low and high relative pressures were identified for both samples, representing the existence of micropores and large mesopores, respectively (Fig. S2a†). According to the BJH pore size distribution (PSD), narrow PSDs centered at ca. 25 and 50 nm were observed for the 3DMCs synthesized using silica spheres (40 and 60 nm), and denoted as 3DMC_25 and 50, respectively (Fig. S2b†). The micropore volumes determined using the t-method for 3DMC_25 and 50 were 0.08 and 0.07 cm3 g−1, respectively, suggesting that both samples possess similar microporosity (Table 1). On the other hand, the specific surface areas (SSA) of 3DMC_25 and 50 calculated based on the BET method were 1147 and 751 m2 g−1, respectively (Table 1), indicating that the difference in the SSA arises from the size of the mesopores, which are dictated by the silica spheres.\nA hot CO2 treatment [CO2(g) + C(s) → 2CO(g)]37–39 was applied to develop the microporosity of the 3DMCs. After optimizing the CO2 activation process, the isotherms of the activated 3DMCs, denoted as 3DMC_25a and 50a, were similar to the parent isotherms with the exception of increased uptakes at very low relative pressure (Fig. S2c†), strongly indicating the large development of microporosity. According to the BJH PSDs (Fig. S2d†), the narrow PSDs centered at 25 and 50 nm for both samples remained intact, confirming the negligible impact of the hot CO2 treatment on the mesoporosity of the parent carbons. In contrast, the microporosity of 3DMC_25a and 50a was highly developed, which reached up to 0.28 and 0.31 cm3 g−1, respectively (Table 1). In addition, the SSAs of 3DMC_25a and 50a increased to 1268 and 1050 cm3 g−1, respectively, due to the developed microporosity during the activation process (Table 1).\nMeanwhile, according to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the existence of Si is clearly identified. The Si contents of 3DMC_25 and 50 were 3.84 and 3.1 wt%, respectively. These Si contents increased to 6.01 and 5.38 wt% for 3DMC_25a and 50a, respectively (Table 1). It seems that the Si moieties chemically connected to the 3DMC surface even after etching process remained intact, and the existence of the remaining Si moieties on the carbon surface had been overlooked in many cases.\nThe co-doping of Fe and N was accomplished using three different 3DMCs (3DMC_25, 25a, and 50a) containing Si, which were denoted as FeSiNC_25, 25a, and 50a, respectively. According to the XRD analyses, the excess Fe species, e.g., Fe, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4,40–42 were identified in all samples after the first pyrolysis step. They were then completely removed by the acid treatment, and then the second heat treatment was applied (Fig. S3†). The textural features of FeSiNC_25, 25a, and 50a were similar to their parent materials with the exception of their reduced microporosity (Fig. 1b and S4a†). The BJH profiles for FeSiNC samples exhibit almost identical to their parent materials (Fig. 1c and S4b†). The SSAs for FeSiNC_25, 25a, and 50a were decreased to 609, 788, and 629 m2 g−1, respectively, in which a similar decrease was also found for the micropore volume of the samples (1.92, 2.5, and 2.17 cm3 g−1, respectively) (Table 1). Therefore, the reduced microporosity of the FeSiNC samples is attributed to the formation of catalytic sites within the micropores, eventually resulting in a decrease in SSA, while the large mesopores were well preserved during the doping process.\nThe SEM (Fig. 1d, e and S4c†) and TEM images (see insets of Fig. 1d and e) of 3DMC_25, 25a, and 50a clearly show almost the same surface features compared to their parent materials, confirming the well-preserved 3D interconnected large mesoporosity. According to the elementary analysis (EA) results for nitrogen, 1.3, 1.98, and 2.02 wt% N were found to be involved in the Fe–N–C_25, 25a, and 50a samples, respectively, the amounts of which are correlated with the trend of the micropore volumes of the carbon supports (Table 1). In addition, the elementary mapping of FeSiNC_25a and 50a was achieved using high-angle annular dark-field imaging-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (HAADF-EDX) mapping in scanning TEM (STEM). Elemental mapping of C, N, Fe, and Si was successfully accomplished for FeSiNC_25a and 50a, clearly confirming the spatial distribution of the Fe, Si and N species on the carbonaceous supports (Fig. 1f and g).\nFor identifying the role of the Si dopant in FeNC, FeNC without Si using 3DMC_50a (denoted as FeNC_50a) was synthesized. KOH etching treatment was applied for physically etching Si from 3DMC-50a (3DMC_50a_KOH). According to XPS analysis, the Si content of 3DMC_50a_KOH was decreased to 0.91 w% from 5.4 wt% of 3DMC_50a. Even though Si was not completely removed by this approach, a significant amount of Si was removed from the parent carbon, so the additional process was achieved. FeNC_50a prepared via loading Fe and nitrogen precursors using 3DMC_50a_KOH possesses a Si content of 0.05 wt% compared to 0.21 wt% of FeSiNC_50a, and a similar Fe content of 0.69 wt% compared with 0.6 wt% of FeSiNC_50a (Table 1), showing that FeNC_50a with significantly reduced Si content could have comparable ORR activity with FeSiNC_50a. In addition, the textural feature of FeNC_50a is similar to FeSiNC_50a. The values for SSA (604 m2 g−1) and the micropore volume (0.10 cm3 g−1) of FeNC_50a are comparable to those (SSA: 629 m2 g−1 and micropore volume 0.1 cm3 g−1) of FeSiNC_50a (Fig. S5† and Table 1).\nTo clarify the atomically distributed FeSixN4−x sites on 3DMC, the atomic-resolution HAADF image and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analyses of FeSiNC_50a were carried out. Fig. 2a clearly shows the turbostratic graphitic domains across the carbon surface, which is associated with the exposed steps and edges of the graphite basal planes.5 According to Fig. S3,† the XRD peak for graphite (002) of FeSiNC_50a is broad, obviously confirming the small graphitic domain size with exposed basal planes. In addition, the atomic-resolution HAADF image definitely presents the single Fe atom distribution marked with red circles over the carbon surface. According to the EEL spectra obtained from the red square area in Fig. S6,† the Si L-edge, N K-edge, and Fe L-edge were clearly identified (Fig. 2b).5,43–45 The atomic weight percentages of Fe, Si, and N of FeSiNC_50a are 0.42, 0.19, and 1.13%, respectively (Table 1). Therefore, the atomically distributed FeSixN4−x sites on the carbon surface are undoubtedly identified.\nXPS was used to identify the chemical structure of the FeSiNC samples. According to the survey spectra obtained for FeSiNC_25a and 50a, there are several peaks (including C, N, and O (Fig. S7a and b†)). In addition, there were relatively small, but detectable amounts of Fe and Si. The atomic amounts of Fe, Si, and N are 0.55, 0.19, and 1.68 for FeSiNC_25a, and 0.6, 0.21, and 1.74 for FeSiNC50a, respectively (Tables 1 and S1†). The amount of Fe is slightly higher than that obtained from EELS, but the Si amount is similar to the EELS result. The high-resolution XPS spectra of N1s recorded for both samples show the presence of four different nitrogen species, i.e., pyridinic (∼398.5 eV), pyrrolic (∼399.9 eV), quaternary (∼401.2 eV), and oxidized nitrogen (∼402.5 eV) (Fig. 3a and b).37,38,46,47 Their integral percentages were obtained using a deconvolution process (Fig. 3c). The majority of the N species in FeSiNC_25a and 50a were edge-located pyridinic and pyrrolic Ns. In particular, the amounts of pyridinic N were 42.1 and 44.9 wt%, respectively (Fig. 3c). The pyridinic Ns located on the edges of the micropores could be preferentially coordinated to the Fe center to form Fe–N4 sites that are responsible for the ORR activity.7,14,16 In addition, the high-resolution XPS spectra of Si 2p recorded for both samples clearly show the chemical bonding between Si and C, as well as Fe (Fig. S7c and d†).48–50\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to further characterize the local geometric and electronic structure of the Fe center in FeSiNC_25a and 50a. The Fe K-edge X-ray near-edge structure (XANES) spectra obtained for FeSiNC_25a and 50a show characteristic pre-edge peaks at 7114 eV, corresponding to the transition of the square-planar Fe–N4,9,47 which was confirmed using iron phthalocyanine (FePC) and iron foil reference samples (Fig. 3d). In addition, the Fourier-transform k2-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra and their best fits with scattering-path contributions (Fe–N, Fe–Si, and Fe–C) are displayed in Fig. 3e. The major peaks observed at ca. 1.5 Å in both samples correspond to the Fe–N bonds, which are in good agreement with the FePC reference sample.9,51,52 Unlike the FePC and Fe foil reference samples, on the other hand, FeSiNC_25a and 50a exhibit another main peak at ca. 1.95 Å, which corresponds to the Fe–Si bond (detailed EXAFS fitting results are shown in Table S2†). In addition to the Fe–Si bonding information from the XPS results, the EXAFS analysis clearly showed the Fe–Si bonding information. Combined with the Fe–N4 information derived from the XANES spectra, atomic-resolution HADDF image and EELS results, the substitution of Si at the N position in the Fe–N4 sites could therefore be logically possible. This would result in the formation of atomically distributed FeSixN4−x sites on the carbon surface, which could co-exist with the square planar Fe–N4 sites.9,51,52 It is noteworthy that the chemical and geometric information of FeSiNC has rarely been reported to date.\nHalf-cell test of FeSiNC\nThe ORR activity of the catalysts was further investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a rotating disk electrode (RDE) (Fig. 4b and S8a–c†). The polarization curves show that the onset potentials observed at 0.1 mA cm−2 for FeSiNC_25, 25a, and 50a were 0.024, 0.052, and 0.056 V, respectively, which are in agreement with the cathodic peak potentials observed in CV (Fig. 4b and Table 1). In addition, the half-wave potentials of FeSiNC_25, 25a, and 50a were −0.12, −0.108, and −0.106 V, respectively, which are similar to the trend of the onset potentials. The onset and half-wave potentials observed for FeSiNC_25a and 50a were even higher than those for commercial Pt/C (0.046 V and −0.11 V), and the ORR activity of FeSiNC_50a was comparable to the best values previously reported for the most efficient non-PBCs (Fig. 4b, Tables 1 and S3†).\nTo further evaluate the ORR kinetics of the FeSiNC samples, the kinetic current densities observed at −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl were obtained via derivation from the mass-transport correction of the polarization curves. FeSiNC_50a presents a higher kinetic current density of 46.8 mA cm−2 compared to FeSiNC_25 and 25a (37.4 and 44.9 mA cm−2, respectively) (Fig. 4c). In addition, the electron-transfer number (n) per O2 for the samples was obtained using the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) equation with the polarization curves recorded at various rotating rates (400–1600 rpm) and voltages ranging from −1.0 to −0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The linearity and parallelism of the K–L plots obtained for the samples were readily identified, suggesting the first-order kinetics toward the dissolved O2 molecules in KOH solution (Fig. 4d and S8†).14,53 The n values observed at −0.6 V calculated from the K–L plots for FeSiNC_25, 25a, and 50a were 3.78, 3.92, and 4.0, respectively (Fig. 4d and Table 1). Again, the activated samples exhibit superior ORR kinetics that proceed via a more favorable four-electron pathway. Furthermore, FeSiNC_50a shows a higher n value than FeSiNC_25a.\nWhen comparing the ORR performance observed for FeSiNC_25 and 25a that have the same mesoporosity, the superior ORR activity for FeSiNC_25a clearly confirms the importance of developing the microporosity where the catalytic sites are located. For activated samples, on the other hand, FeSiNC_50a presents a slightly higher ORR performance than FeSiNC_25a. Both samples possess almost identical weight percentages of Fe, Si, and N (Table 1), similar percentages of edge-located N species, i.e., pyridinic and pyrrolic N (Fig. 3c), and similar local geometric and electronic structures, according to the XAS analyses shown in Fig. 3d and e. The main differences between these samples are the textural features, in which FeSiNC_50a presented slightly smaller SSA and micropore volume, and a two times larger mesopore. Therefore, it seems reasonable that the higher ORR activity observed for FeSiNC_50a can be attributed to the facile approach of the O2 molecules to the catalytic sites via the larger mesopores.\nIn addition, the ORR activity of FeNC_50a was evaluated. The onset and half-wave potentials of FeNC_50a are 0.049 and −0.114 V, which are inferior to those (onset potential: 0.056 V and half-wave potential: −0.106 V) of FeSiNC_50a, and those of (onset potential: 0.052 V and half-wave potential: −0.108 V) of FeSiNC_25a (Fig. S9† and Table 1). The onset and half-wave potentials located in the kinetic control region are strongly associated with the catalytic activity of the samples. In addition, the n value for FeNC_50a is 3.91, which is slightly lower than that for FeSiNC_50a (Fig. S9† and Table 1). When considering the similar Fe catalytic site densities determined by XPS analyses and textural features for both FeSiNC_50a and FeNC_50a (Table 1), the superior ORR activity for FeSiNC_50a seems to be strongly associated with the catalytic nature of the FeSiN sites. The origin of this observation will be discussed in the Theoretical calculation section.\nMeanwhile, a methanol tolerance test for FeSiNC_25a and 50a and 20 wt% Pt/C was carried out. While a significant methanol oxidation current was observed for 20 wt% Pt/C, no dramatic change was observed for FeSiNC_25a and 50a (Fig. S10a†). This indicates that the FeSiNCs are tolerant of the methanol crossover reaction, and can be used in direct methanol fuel cells. In addition, the long-term stability of the ORR catalyst is another important point to consider in fuel cell applications. To investigate the ORR stability of FeSiNC_25a and 50a, accelerated durability tests (ADTs) for 5000 cycles were carried out in a 0.1 M KOH solution at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. S7b and c,† there was no obvious shift in the polarization curves after 5000 cycles observed for the FeSiNCs, confirming their outstanding ORR stability (Fig. S10b and c†).\nSingle-cell test of FeSiNC\nWhen the power density curves for both samples were plotted using different catalyst loadings (Fig. 5a and b), the maximum power density at 6 mg cm−2 observed for FeSiNC_50a was 150% higher than that of FeSiNC_25a, which is a much larger difference when compared to the 118% higher maximum power density of FeSiNC_50a compared to FeSiNC_25a obtained at 1.1 mg cm−2. In particular, the power density of FeSiNC_50 (123 mW cm−2) at a catalyst loading of 6 mg cm−2 was even higher than that of the commercial Pt/C (108 mW cm−2, Fig. 4b), and comparable to the best values obtained using the most efficient non-PBCs reported to date (Table S4†). In addition, the current density curve for FeSiNC_50a obtained at 6 mg cm−2 was much higher than that for FeSiNC_25a over the entire voltage range, which was even higher than that obtained for Pt/C. Therefore, the pronounced ZAB performance of FeSiNC_50a can be ascribed to the enhanced mass-transport properties via larger mesopores, enabling easy access to the catalytic sites (Fig. 5c).\nSubsequently, the rate performance of FeSiNC_25a, 50a, and the commercial Pt/C sample at a catalyst loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 with various current densities (1–20 mA cm−2) was evaluated (Fig. S12a†). Over all current density ranges, FeSiNC_50a exhibited superior rate performance compared to FeSiNC_25a and the commercial Pt/C. In addition, the typical galvanostatic discharge curves for FeSiNC_25a, 50a and the commercial Pt/C sample at a catalyst loading of 2.5 mg cm−2 and current density of 10 mA cm−2 were monitored (Fig. S12b†). It was found that FeSiNC_50a presented superior ZAB performance than FeSiNC_25a and the commercial Pt/C. The more pronounced properties of the rate performance and galvanostatic discharge profile for FeSiNC_50a than the other samples could therefore be ascribed to the enhanced mass-transport property derived from the 3D interconnected large mesopore.\nFurthermore, AEMFC was performed using the FeSiNC_25a and 50a samples to account for the effect of mass-transport due to the mesopore size on the single-cell performance. When a catalyst loading of 1 mg cm−2 was used, the maximum power density of FeSiNC_50a was 150 mW cm−2, which is slightly higher (109%) than that observed for FeSiNC_25a (137 mW cm−2, Fig. 6a). On the other hand, when the catalyst loading was increased to 3 mg cm−2, the maximum power density of FeSiNC_50a was increased to 208 mW cm−2. This is 130% higher than that observed for FeSiNC_25a (160 mW cm−2, Fig. 6b), clearly confirming the mass-transport effect of the larger mesopores in Fe–Si–N–C_50a on the single-cell performance.\nMeanwhile, the polarization curves obtained for both samples at a catalyst loading of 1 mg cm−2 showed that the current densities observed at 0.6 V for FeSiNC_25a and 50a were 140 and 180 mA cm−2, respectively, which were increased to 320 and 382 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V, respectively (Fig. 6a and c). It is notable that the high voltage region was dominated by the catalytic activity, which depends on the catalytic site density.54,55 On the other hand, the mass-transport mainly affects the polarization in the low voltage region, so that the difference in the current density obtained at 0.4 V for both samples is slightly increased compared to that obtained from 0.6 V.29,55 This tendency was enhanced when the catalyst loading reached 3 mg cm−1.2 The current densities observed at 0.6 and 0.4 V for FeSiNC_25a and 50a were 200 and 240, and 400 and 520 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig. 6b and d). In particular, the difference in the current density obtained at 0.4 V for both samples was much bigger than that measured at 1 mg cm−2. This result clearly reveals that the mass-transport was significantly affected by the pore size of the catalyst. Therefore, the enhanced single-cell performance due to facilitating mass-transport via larger mesopores was clearly demonstrated, which provides a design principle for high-performance AEMFC. It is notable that the AEMFC performance of FeSiNC_50a is comparable to the best non-PBCs previously reported (Table S5†).\nTheoretical calculations for proving the origin of the ORR activity of FeSiNC\nGiven the six well-established FeSiNC structures (FeSiNCPdN-BS, FeSiNCPrN-BS, SFNCPdN-AE, FeSiNCPdN-ZE, FeSiNCPdN-IE, and FeSiNCPrN-IE), we systematically investigated the ORR overpotential (ηORR). We considered all possible active sites (Fig. 7a, S13 and S15†) for the catalysts based on a general free energy diagram (FED) approach (Fig. S17 and S18†) and the construction of an ORR volcano plot (Fig. 7b).56,57 The calculated results show that FeSiNCPrN-BS has the lowest ηORR (0.40 V), which demonstrates improved performance when compared to a conventional Pt catalyst (0.46 V). In addition, the FeSiNC structures have two characteristic electrocatalytic features. When compared to conventional FeNC structures with only active Fe sites in the edge region,5 the FeSiNC structures have active carbon sites in both the edge and basal regions. In addition, the catalytic activity is remarkably improved by the adjacent Si dopant.\nTo understand the effect of the Si dopant on the ORR catalytic activity of the FeSiNC catalysts, we systematically investigated the geometric and electronic structures of the FeSiNCs, focusing on FeSiNCPrN-BS with the lowest ηORR. As shown in Fig. 5c, the large Si atom in FeSiNC leads to structural deformation by inducing the sp3 hybridization of the C atoms in the deformed region.58,59 Therefore, compared to sp2-C, the sp3-C sites can efficiently promote chemical bonding with the intermediates (, O*, OH* and OOH*) formed during the ORR process. In the case of FeSiNCPrN-BS, there is a concave region for the chemical bonding of the sp3-C sites. In addition, the C sites near Si (C@near Si) have significantly improved catalytic activity when compared to those far from Si (C@far Si) in the planar region, which reveals that the ORR activity at the C@near Si (C4) site is superior to that at the C@far Si (C9) site (Fig. 6c). Due to this geometric effect, all of the edge and basal regions can be activated and the catalytic activity promoted. Consequently, the abundant C sites, especially C@near Si, play an important role in improving the ORR activity in our FeSiNC system. However, in the case of the Fe metal, which is known as the active site in the conventional FeNC structures, the ηORR is substantially increased due to the strong bonds formed with the intermediate states (, O*, OH* and OOH*), as shown in Fig. 7d. It is well-known that the catalytic activity of the metals can be estimated using the d-band center theory proposed by Hammer and Norskov.60 The bond strength of an adsorbent on the metal surface is closely related to the filling of the anti-bonding state near the Fermi level, which depends on the position of the d-band center involved in the catalytic reaction. The partially filled anti-bonding state leads to a suitable bond strength of the adsorbent and good ORR activity. A representative example is Pt, which partially fills the anti-bonding state with a d-band center at −2.61 eV. The partial density of states (PDOS) analysis of the Fe d-orbital in FeSiNCPrN-BS reveals that the d-band center of Fe is located at −0.16 eV (Fig. S19†). This significantly higher value compared to Pt signifies the strong chemical bond formed between Fe and the intermediates upon emptying the anti-bonding state. For the reasons mentioned above, one can envision that the abundant activated C sites will be more beneficial than the Fe sites toward boosting the ORR catalytic performance (Fig. 7d).\nIn addition, we analyzed the electronic structures of FeSiNCPrN-BS using the partial density of state (PDOS) because the contribution from the active sites to the frontier states near the Fermi level is strongly associated with the active site preference.61 PDOS analysis of FeSiNCPrN-BS shows that the C@near Si sites make a particularly large contribution to the frontier states near the Fermi level, but there is no contribution from the C@far Si sites (Fig. 7e). These results also support the active site preference for C@near Si in FeSiNCPrN-BS. Subsequently, we focused our attention toward the changes in the total carbon charge due to the Si atom in the FeSiNC structures because the catalytic activity can be significantly affected by the variation in the electron concentration on the active sites. Fig. 7f shows the electron transfer from the Si atom to the C sheet, which means that the FeSiNCs can have higher ORR catalytic activity than FeNCs due to the electron-rich C active sites induced by electron transfer from the Si atom. Consequently, these results clearly show that doping Si atoms into the FeNC structure plays a crucial role in enhancing the ORR activity. In particular, the abundant activated sp3-C sites on the basal plane lead to the novelty of the FeSiNC electrocatalysts and the outstanding ORR performance observed in an alkaline environment. This is due to the synergy between the geometric and electronic effects. This finding implies that more active sites could be prompted from FeSiNC compared to the conventional FeNC ORR catalyst, which has been well known as one of the most efficient non-PBCs.', '4.
