Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2ER) still faces the challenges of low product selectivity, high overpotential, and high cost of electrocatalysts. Herein, we develop a low-cost and highly efficient precious-metal-free CO2ER electrocatalyst, composed of Ni nanoparticles (NPs) with the size range of 50–100 nm, confined within N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) with the diameter of 100–200 nm (Ni@NCNTs). Benefitting from the confinement effect, the resulting 1D Ni@NCNTs hybrid exhibits an exceptional electrocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO production with a relatively positive onset potential of −0.3 V, low Tafel slope of 97 mV dec−1, and high Faradaic efficiency of 99.1%. The high selectivity of Ni@NCNTs for CO production during the CO2ER is almost the best among all previously reported N-doped carbon based CO2ER electrocatalysts. Experimental observations demonstrate that the confined Ni NPs inside NCNTs is a key step to promote the conversion of CO2 to CO. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the confinement effect of NCNTs can weaken the binding strengths between Ni NPs and *CO intermediates, thus improving the rate-limiting step of *CO desorption during the CO2ER process. Further integration of 1D Ni@NCNTs electrocatalyst with a solar panel or two alkaline batteries enable highly active and sustainable CO2ER and water splitting.

Electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2ER) to carbon monoxide (CO) or other high-value-added chemicals is one of the viable approaches to remit global warming. As one of the primary components for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [
1
], CO gas could be produced by CO2ER with different kinds of electrocatalysts, including precious metals (such as Au, Ag, and alloys) [
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
], metal oxides (such as Au2O3, ZnO) [
5
,
6
], and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) [
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
], etc. However, for all of above these catalysts, either their cost was too high or selectivity in producing CO was poor, which essentially limit their practical applications. Recently, N-doped carbon materials as metal-free electrocatalysts have attracted wide attention due to their low cost and great conductivity [
[10]
,
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]

[17]
]. Although it has been proved that the introduction of N atoms into the nanocarbons could enhance the CO2ER catalytic activity and selectivity to produce CO [
18
], the CO selectivity of current reported N-doped carbon materials was yet unsatisfactory [
19
,
20
]. For instance, N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) showed the maximum Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of 80% for CO production at −0.78 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) [
21
]. Further modification of NCNTs with enhancing the percentage of pyrrolic-N dopant through a steam-etching strategy resulted in an improved electrocatalytic CO2ER activity with the maximum F.E. of 88% at −0.5 V [
22
].
The concept of “confinement effect” within CNTs has been studied in previous work [
23
]. For Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the iron confined inside the CNTs improved the yield of C5+ hydrocarbons about 1.5 times over the iron deposited on the exterior surface of CNTs [
24
]. The confinement of iron particles inside the NCNTs also exhibited a remarkable activity for oxygen electroreduction reaction [
25
]. The CNTs confined Pt was applied for hydrogenation of α-Ketoester, and its reaction activity was about 10-fold higher, compared with that of Pt deposited on the exterior surface of CNTs [
26
].
The Sabatier principle indicated that the adsorption energy of intermediates was neither too strong nor too weak to achieve high catalytic activity. The activities of catalysts were also found to perform a ‘volcano’ trend with adsorption energy. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the catalyst located at left leg of volcano was limited by the desorption process. Meanwhile, the theoretical calculations also reflected that confined space can weaken the adsorption energy between intermediates and catalysts [
23
], where a promotion of catalytic activity can be expected on the reactions limited by the desorption process. Additionally, CO desorption has been proved to be the rate-determining step for CO2ER on Ni surface. Therefore, inspired from confinement effect, we reported a successful trial to tune the catalytic activity for CO2ER and achieve a high CO selectivity. Combining theoretical guidances and experimental verifications showcased a way for rational design of catalysts.
Herein, we developed a 1D precious-metal-free CO2ER hybrid electrocatalyst by encapsulating Ni nanoparticles (NPs) with size of 50–100 nm inside the NCNTs with the diameter of 100–200 nm via a one-step carbonization strategy under an N2 atmosphere at 1000 °C (Ni@NCNTs). Experimental results showed that the Ni@NCNTs possess an unexceptionable catalytic activity and selectivity with an onset potential of −0.3 V, low Tafel slope of 97 mV dec−1, and high F.E. of 99.1% for CO production and suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Such a high selectivity of Ni@NCNTs for CO production during the CO2ER was almost the best among all the previously reported N-doped carbon based CO2ER electrocatalysts. DFT calculations revealed that the CO2ER catalytic activity arises from the confined metallic Ni NPs, and the weakening adsorption energy between *CO intermediates and Ni NPs played a positive effect on *CO desorption and thus promoted CO2ER kinetics, in agreement with the experimental results.
Dicyandiamide (DCDA, 24 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (DI water, 30 mL) with stirring. Then, nickel chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2·6H2O, 0.84 mmol) was added and dissolved in the above solution. The mixed solution was heated and kept at 65 °C for 6 h to let the homogeneously mixed powder dry out. The greenish powder was placed on an alumina boat and annealed at 500 °C in a tube furnace for 2 h under N2 atmosphere, and then the temperature was raised to 700, 800, 900 or 1000 °C, and kept for another 2 h. The final black powder was etched by 0.5 M H2SO4 for 24 h, and further washed with DI water for a few times until the pH ≈ 7.0. The resultant materials were denoted as Ni@NCNTs-700, Ni@NCNTs-800, Ni@NCNTs-900, and Ni@NCNTs. Moreover, Co2+ and Fe3+ were chosen to replace Ni2+ and annealed at 1000 °C for synthesis of Co@NCNTs and Fe@NCNTs, respectively.
N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs, xfnano, Nanjing, 200 mg) was dispersed in the nickel acetate solution (30 mL, 5.22 mg mL−1) by ultrasonication. After drying by evaporation, the powder was placed on an alumina boat and annealed at 900 °C in a tube furnace for 3 h under H2 atmosphere. In the process, the Ni2+ was reduced to metallic Ni that was in situ grown on the outside surface of NCNTs.
The morphologies of samples were obtained by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements (SU-8010, Hitachi and Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were performed on X-ray diffractometer (ZETIUM DY 2186, 4 kW). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were determined by Escalab 250 Xi XPS with an Al Kα X-ray resource (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The chemical environment of products was measured by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility BL14W1). Raman spectrum was tested on Laser copolymerization Raman spectrometer (LabRAM HR Evolution, 532 nm). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore size distributions of samples were estimated by specific surface area and mesoporous analyzer (TriStar II). The content of nickel in the Ni@NCNTs was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, TA-Q500). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of Ni@NCNTs was performed on MAGNA 560.
All electrochemical measurements were performed in a H-type three-electrode cell on electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E). The H-type three-electrode cell using Pt wire acted as the counter electrode (CE), Ag/AgCl electrode acted as the reference electrode (RE), and the working electrode was carbon paper loaded with various catalysts (WE: catalyst-CP). To prepare the working electrode, 10 mg of as-prepared catalyst was dispersed in ethanol (900 μL) and 0.5 wt% Nafion solution (100 μL) with 2 h sonication to form a homogeneous ink. Then, 100 μL of the suspension solution was dropped and dried onto a 1 × 1 cm2 carbon paper (loading amount of 1.0 mg cm−2). The cell was separated by a proton membrane (Nafion 117), and both sides contained 25 mL of 0.5 M KHCO3 solution (pH ≈ 7.2) as the electrolyte. The Ar/CO2 (S. J. Smith, 99.999%) was passed through the electrolyte for at least 30 min before the measurements to form the Ar/CO2 saturated electrolyte. The polarization curves were performed with a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The ECSA referred the CV measurement was tested at the potential range of −0.3 ∼ −0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by applying an AC voltage with 10 mV amplitude in a frequency range from 100 KHz to 10 mHz. The gaseous and liquid products were quantified by on-line GC and off-line 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), respectively.
All potentials involved in this work were relative to RHE. The conversion of the potentials vs. Ag/AgCl to vs. RHE was according to the following equation:
where the experimental temperature is 25 °C; the pH of 0.5 M KHCO3 solution is 7.2; V0Ag/AgCl vs. NHE is 0.197 V at 25 °C.
For two-electrode CO2ER-OER device, the cathode was the 1 × 1 cm2 carbon paper loading 1.0 mg cm−2 of Ni@NCNTs, and the anode was the 1 × 1 cm2 carbon paper loading 1.0 mg cm−2 of commercial Ir/C (20 wt%).
The adsorption and reaction energies of a variety of species (including *CO2, *COOH and *CO) were calculated by using the Vienna ab initio simulation packages (VASP) [
27
] in the framework of density function theory (DFT). The Kohn-Sham equation was solved in terms of projector augmented wave (PAW) formalism [
28
] and Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [
29
] at the level of generalized gradient approximations (GGA). The kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV was set for the plane wave expansion. As the CNT systems are pretty large in size, we only sample at gamma point for total energy integration. The total electronic energy and Hellmann-Feynman force threshold was set to 10−5 eV and −0.05 eV Å−1, respectively. All the CNT models are periodic in three dimensions.
The representative data obtained from the electrochemical workstation and GC at −0.8 V are shown in
Table S2
.
The volume of the gas collecting valve (V0) in our gas chromatograph is 1.0 mL and the CO2 flow rate is v = 20 mL min−1. The time to collecting the gas is:
Under normal temperature and pressure (26 °C, 1.013 × 105 Pa, the amount of gas V0 = 1.0 mL) is:
The reduction of 1 molecule CO2 to 1 molecule CO required 2-electrons, take the F.E. of Ni@NCNTs as an example, the electrons (NCO) needed to produce x ppm of CO (mol/mol, measured by GC) is:
For Ni@NCNTs, the average current when injecting the effluent gas into GC is I = −8.08 mA (measured by electrochemical workstation). During this sampling process, the total number of electrons (Ntotal) is calculated:
Thus, the F.E. for CO production is:
The Ni@NCNTs was synthesized via a one-step pyrolysis strategy under N2 atmosphere at an elevated temperature in the range of 700–1000 °C (
Scheme S1
). XRD pattern verified the formation of graphitic carbon and metallic Ni in the Ni@NCNTs catalyst (
Fig. S1
) [
30
,
31
]. The FESEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (
Fig. S2-S3
) showed the morphologies of Ni@NCNTs with Ni NPs encapsulated inside the NCNTs. The diameter of NCNTs and the size of Ni NPs was 100–200 nm and 50–100 nm, respectively. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of Ni@NCNTs exhibited three groups of mutually symmetrical diffraction spots (inset of
Fig. 1
a), which are attributed to the metallic Ni. Further HRTEM image (
Fig. 1
a) of Ni@NCNTs clearly showed that the Ni NPs were wrapped in layers of NCNTs, and the thickness of NCNT's walls was around 3 nm. The specific lattice spacings of Ni NPs and graphitic carbon were ∼0.21 nm and ∼0.35 nm, corresponding to Ni (111) and graphite (002) planes, respectively. High-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and corresponding elemental distribution mapping of Ni@NCNTs illustrated that the Ni NPs was well encapsulated inside the NCNTs, and the N atoms was homogeneously distributed through the whole NCNTs (
Fig. S4
). Raman spectrum in
Fig. 1
b further confirmed the presence of graphitic carbon in Ni@NCNTs with the D and G bands locating at 1354 and 1582 cm−1 [
32
,
33
]. The ID/IG value of Ni@NCNTs was 0.82, indicating that the Ni@NCNTs has a high degree of graphitization. TGA analysis revealed that the content of Ni NPs in the Ni@NCNTs was 26 wt% (
Fig. S5
). XPS survey spectrum of Ni@NCNTs presented that the Ni content was about 0.89 at.% (
Fig. S6
), illustrating that the Ni NPs were well encapsulated inside the NCNTs, rather than deposited on the outside surface of NCNTs [
34
]. The total N content of Ni@NCNTs was measured to be 4.07 at.%, and four types of N species can be distinguished in the high-resolution N 1s XPS spectrum (
Fig. 1
c), including pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, and oxidized N species at binding energies of 398.5, 399.9, 401.2, and 403.1 eV, respectively [
[35]
,
[36]
,
[37]
]. The emerging of C=N bonds in the high-resolution C 1s XPS spectrum (
Fig. S7
), further demonstrated the successful incorporation of N atoms into carbon matrix. The geometric structure and coordination situation of Ni species in Ni@NCNTs were further measured by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). As shown in
Fig. 1
d, the positions of pre-edge features of Ni@NCNTs were located at the same binding energy as the Ni foil, suggesting that the chemical valence of Ni species in Ni@NCNTs was the metallic Ni0. The Fourier transformed (FT) EXAFS spectra of Ni foil and Ni@NCNTs were given in
Fig. 1
e, in which the peak centred at 2.15 Å, corresponding to the Ni–Ni bonds [
38
,
39
], was obviously observed in Ni@NCNTs, while the peak located at 1.6 Å, corresponding to Ni–N bonds, was not emerged in Ni@NCNTs, excluding the presence of Ni–N species in Ni@NCNTs. Besides, the FT-EXAFS fitting results demonstrated that the coordination number and length of Ni–Ni bonds in Ni@NCNTs was close to those of Ni foil (
Fig. 1
f,
Fig. S8
, and
Table S1
), further confirming that the Ni species in the Ni@NCNTs were in form of the metallic Ni. Based on these results, one can conclude that the Ni species in the Ni@NCNTs existed as Ni NPs instead of other Ni species. The N2 adsorption-desorption curve of Ni@NCNTs showed a high specific surface area of 69 m2 g−1 and pore diameter of 23 nm (
Fig. S9
), which is favourable for active sites exposure for CO2ER electrocatalysis [
40
].

The electrocatalytic activity and selectivity of as-prepared Ni@NCNTs toward CO2ER were evaluated in 0.5 M CO2-saturated KHCO3 electrolyte using a H-type three-electrode cell (
Fig. S10
). All potentials involved in this work were relative to RHE. In Ar-saturated KHCO3 with only HER has occurred, the onset potential of Ni@NCNTs was −0.6 V, while in CO2-saturated one, the onset potential was positively increased to −0.3 V (
Fig. 2
a and
Fig. S11
), associated with corresponding increase in the current density, suggesting that in the presence of CO2, the Ni@NCNTs catalysed the CO2ER efficiently. In contrast, the catalytic activity of Ni deposited on outside surface of NCNTs (Ni-NCNTs,
Fig. S12-S14
), bare NCNTs, and Ni NPs for CO2ER were also measured (
Fig. 2
b). Notably, the Ni@NCNTs showed the most positive onset potential of −0.3 V and the largest current density from −0.4 V to −0.9 V as compared with other control samples. In addition, the Ni@NCNTs achieved a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a more positive potential of −0.72 V, whereas the Ni-NCNTs, bare NCNTs, and Ni NPs required potentials of −0.89 V, −0.82 V, and −1.07 V, respectively, to reach the same current density. These results indicated that the confinement effect in Ni@NCNTs can efficiently promote the electrochemical activity for CO2ER.

(A colour version of this figure can be viewed online.)
The gaseous and liquid-phase products from Ni@NCNTs for CO2ER were quantified by on-line gas chromatograph (GC) (
Table S2
) and off-line 1H NMR, respectively. As shown in
Fig. 2
c, the Ni@NCNTs exhibited a remarkable suppressed HER process, achieving a high selectivity for CO production with the maximum F.E. of 99.1% at −0.8 V, while the Ni-NCNTs, bare NCNTs, and Ni NPs only delivered the maximum F.E. of 34.9%, 35.9%, and 0.3% for CO production, respectively. Notably, the content of N dopant and the amount of Ni species in the Ni-NCNTs were measured to be 3.99 at.% and 26 wt%, respectively, which are similar to those of in the Ni@NCNTs. The Ni@NCNTs exhibited an obvious enhanced selectivity for CO production than the Ni-NCNTs, demonstrating the positive role of the confinement effect by confining Ni NPs inside the NCNTs for the CO2ER.
Additionally, the partial current density, contributed to CO production (jco), was shown in
Fig. 2
d. The Ni@NCNTs exhibited a partial current density of −8.01 mA cm−2 at −0.8 V, which was much higher than other control samples at the same applied potential (such as, −0.84 mA cm−2 for Ni-NCNTs, −1.67 mA cm−2 for bare NCNTs, and −0.002 mA cm−2 for Ni NPs). The enhanced CO F.E. and specific CO current density of Ni@NCNTs clarified the crucial role of confined Ni NPs in Ni@NCNTs for CO2ER. To further identify the active sites of Ni@NCNTs, the effect of doped N atoms on CO2ER activity and selectivity were studied (
Fig. S15-S17
). Although the Ni@NCNTs possessed the lowest content of N dopants among the control samples (
Fig. 2
e), only a slight improvement in CO2ER activity and selectivity was observed for Ni@NCNTs compared with the Ni@NCNTs-700 (F E. of 96.9%), Ni@NCNTs-800 (F E. of 94.2%), and Ni@NCNTs-900 (F E. of 95.6%), implying that the N-doping did not play a decisive role for the enhanced CO2ER activity. These results, coupled with HRTEM images, elemental mappings, XANES and EXAFS results can be used to safely conclude that the confined Ni NPs was the main active sites for CO production via CO2ER on Ni@NCNTs catalyst. Moreover, the total F.E. for CO and H2 productions from Ni@NCNTs was calculated to be around 100%, indicating that no any other liquid-phase products were formed during the CO2ER process, which was also supported by 1H NMR results (
Fig. S18
). Importantly, the high CO F.E. of 99.1% for Ni@NCNTs was almost the best performance among all previously reported N-doped carbon based CO2ER electrocatalysts (
Fig. 2
f and
Table S3
).
Fig. 3
a showed the time-dependent current densities of Ni@NCNTs for CO2ER at different applied potentials. Only a slight decay in current density after 10 h of continuous reaction was observed at all potentials, suggesting its favourable stability. We further studied the long-term durability of Ni@NCNTs for CO2ER catalysis at −0.8 V (
Fig. 3
b), during which the current density showed only a minor decrease after 20 h test, while maintaining a high F.E. of 96% for CO production. These results indicated the highly efficient and stable electrocatalysis of Ni@NCNTs for CO2ER. The Tafel slope of Ni@NCNTs was calculated to be 97 mV dec−1 (
Fig. 3
c), which was much smaller than that of Ni-NCNTs (189 mV dec−1), bare NCNTs (136 mV dec−1), and Ni NPs (162 mV dec−1), respectively, suggesting a more remarkable kinetics for the formation of *CO intermediates during CO2ER process [
41
]. The fast kinetics of Ni@NCNTs was further supported by EIS results. The Nyquist plots of Ni@NCNTs revealed that the charge-transfer resistance of Ni@NCNTs was much lower than those of Ni-NCNTs, bare NCNTs, and Ni NPs (
Fig. 3
d), suggesting that the Ni@NCNTs possess a fast charge-transfer capacity during the CO2ER process [
42
]. To estimate the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was measured through collected cyclic voltammograms (CV) curves (
Fig. S19
) [
[43]
,
[44]
,
[45]
,
[46]
]. The values of Cdl for Ni@NCNTs, Ni-NCNTs, NCNTs, and Ni NPs were calculated to be 4.29, 2.20, 5.38, and 0.51 mF cm−2, respectively (
Fig. 3
e), demonstrating that the Ni@NCNTs possessed a much higher ECSA value than the Ni-NCNTs. Although the NCNTs exhibited a larger ECSA value than Ni@NCNTs, the former has a lower CO2ER selectivity than the latter, indicating that the remarkable CO2ER performance of Ni@NCNTs was mainly attributed to the enhanced intrinsic activity from confinement effect, instead of the ECSA. Further exploration of other transition metal (TM) NPs (Co and Fe) confined within NCNTs catalysts for CO2ER was also achieved (
Fig. S20-S21
), and the results showed that the Ni@NCNTs possessed the highest catalytic performance toward CO2ER among the three electrocatalysts (
Fig. 3
f,
Fig. S22, and Table S4
), further confirming that the Ni NPs play a vital role in the CO2ER electrocatalysis.

To understand the confinement effect of NCNTs on the activity and selectivity of CO2ER, we examined the CO2ER to CO over a Ni9 cluster inside and outside CNTs and NCNTs with DFT calculations, as shown in
Fig. 4
a. When the Ni9 cluster was supported by CNTs, the adsorption energy between CO2 and Ni9 cluster was about −1.0 eV, while in the confined 1D channel of CNTs, the adsorption energy became weaker, consistent with the previous theoretical calculations that the confinement effect of CNT weaken the binding strength between the adsorbed species and metals [
23
]. The CO2 protonation to *COOH was slightly more favourable on the Ni9 cluster inside the CNTs compared to that of supported on CNTs exteriors. For the step of *COOH protonation and dissociation to H2O and *CO, the reaction energies on the Ni9 cluster inside and outside CNTs were also compared. It was found that *CO adsorption energy over the confined Ni9 cluster was weaker with respect to the supported one. Therefore, the *CO desorption process became faster in the confined microenvironment of CNTs. As shown in
Fig. 4
b–c, *CO→CO was more difficult compared to CO2 protonation in CO2ER. In other words, *CO→CO was the rate-limiting step of CO2ER. It was noteworthy that the real sizes of the Ni NPs were much bigger than that used in our simulations and the real diameters of CNTs were also much larger. Therefore, the actual confinement energy of *CO, *COOH, and *CO2 adsorption should be different from our models [
23
]. Nonetheless, there were solid evidence that the confinement energies were always positive [
47
], consistent trend with our calculations; and the process of CO2→CO has been determined to be limited by *CO desorption [
48
], rationalizing well the observations in the present experimental work. On the other hand, we further investigated the system with NCNTs and the thermodynamic trend can be found in
Fig. 4
d, where a much weaker adsorption energy was obtained inside the NCNTs, while little interactions were outside the tubes. As a result, a lower reaction energy for *CO→CO can be predicted with the weaker binding energy between the Ni NPs and adsorbed *CO. The activity of CO2ER has been proved to be higher with the doped N in CNTs, consistent with the experimental measurements.

Encouraged by the excellent CO2ER results, we further pursued a two-electrode cell that combined carbon paper loading Ni@NCNTs as cathode for CO2ER with carbon paper loading Ir/C as anode for oxygen evolution reduction (OER) to achieve its practical applications. As shown in
Fig. 5
a, the CO2ER-OER device reached a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at ∼3.46 V along with a low onset voltage of ∼1.90 V, which was superior to that of the previously reported Bi/Ir–C catalyst used for the CO2ER-OER electrocatalysis (onset voltage of ∼2.1 V) [
49
]. In addition, the current density only has a slight decrease during the long-term test for 5 h (inset of
Fig. 5
a), suggesting the Ni@NCNTs catalysed CO2ER with high stability. Such a CO2ER-OER electrolysis could be further powered by a commercial planar silicon solar cell (
Fig. 5
b). Under simulated sunlight irradiation (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), the CO2ER-OER electrolyser exhibited a rapid and reproducible transient photocurrent response following repeated ON/OFF illumination cycles, indicating the efficient charge transport of integrated CO2ER-OER device. The obvious gas bubbles formation was clearly observed on Ni@NCNTs cathode and Ir/C anode (
Fig. S23
), demonstrating that the CO2ER-OER electrolysis can be efficiently driven by solar energy. Furthermore, two alkaline batteries were used as an external power source to drive CO2ER-OER electrolysis (

c–d). The batteries-driven CO2ER-OER cell has a current density of ∼5.5 mA cm−2 at beginning and a slight descent in current density to ∼5.0 mA cm−2 after 5 h of continuous reaction. It was worth noting that the average F.E. for CO production during the long-term reaction was measured to be ∼92.7%, suggesting the excellent CO2ER performance of Ni@NCNTs with high stability. These results demonstrated the feasible practical applications of Ni@NCNTs for CO2ER-OER electrolysis.

In summary, a novel 1D highly efficient Ni NPs confined inside NCNTs hybrid electrocatalyst was developed for CO2ER. Benefitting from the confinement effect, the Ni@NCNTs exhibited a remarkable electrocatalytic activity and selectivity with a relatively positive onset potential of −0.3 V, low Tafel slope of 97 mV dec−1, and high F.E. of 99.1% for CO production during the CO2ER. The Ni@NCNTs showed the almost highest selectivity for CO production with respect to all existing N-doped carbon based CO2ER electrocatalysts. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations revealed that the *CO adsorption over the confined Ni NPs was destabilized with respect to the supported one. Thus, the *CO desorption process became faster on the NCNTs with confined Ni NPs, leading to significantly enhanced selectivity for CO production. Moreover, Ni@NCNTs exhibited promising practical applications in integrated CO2ER-OER electrocatalysis systems using solar panel or two alkaline batteries as efficient drivers. The TM NPs enclosed inside the nanocarbons with “confinement effect” would open a new avenue to developing low-cost and highly efficient confined hybrid electrocatalysts for other applications, such as water splitting, oxygen reduction, and ammonia oxidation.
