The development of low-cost, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is urgently demanded for scalable applications in fuel cells or zinc-air batteries (ZABs), but still remains a challenge. Herein, carbon materials with edge-sited Fe-N4 atomic species (E-FeNC) were synthesized from pyrolysis of abundant Fe-containing biomass using silica spheres as hard template. The E-FeNC delivers remarkable ORR performance with a half-wave potential of 0.875 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), much better than Pt/C (0.859 V), attributed to atomically dispersed Fe-N4 moieties nearby graphitic edges. The density functional calculations reveal that O2 molecule adsorbs on Fe-N4 sites with an energetically favorable side-on configuration with elongated OO bond rather than end-on form, boosting the subsequent dissociation pathway with a direct 4e reaction route. Using E-FeNC as cathode catalyst, the primary ZAB exhibits high specific capacity of 710 mA h g−1 and power density of 151.6 mW cm−2. The rechargeable ZAB by coupling E-FeNC and NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) demonstrates long-term capacity retention over 200 h, superior to that using noble Pt/C and RuO2. This unique carbon material with atomically dispersed metal sites opens up an avenue for the design and engineering of electrocatalysts for energy conversion systems.

Porous carbons with edge-sited Fe-N4 species were successfully prepared from Fe-containing abundant biomass, which shows superior electrocatalytic oxygen reduction performance, as well higher power/energy density and stability than commercial Pt/C in Zn-air battery. The theoretical calculations indicate that O2 molecule adsorbs on edged Fe-N4 sites with an energetically favorable side-on configuration with elongated OO bond, boosting the subsequent dissociation pathway with a direct 4e− reaction route.
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a crucial reaction at the cathode in the energy storage devices such as fuel cells and zinc-air batteries (ZABs), which involves the break of strong OO bond (498 kJ mol−1) [

,
2
]. The bond activation and cleavage require highly effective electrocatalysts to lower the energy barrier, thus boosting the sluggish kinetics of ORR. Nowadays, the commercial electrocatalysts are mainly based on noble metal Pt supported by carbon materials (Pt/C) [
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
]. But the scarcity accompanying the prohibitive cost of Pt severely hinders the large-scale application of the foregoing energy storage devices. As a result, it is of paramount importance to develop non-precious ORR electrocatalysts with low cost, high activity and long-term stability to substitute the expensive benchmark Pt-based catalysts [
[6]
,
[7]

[8]
].
Since the pioneering work by Zhang and coworkers in 2011, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted broad research interest due to the high catalytic activity, 100 % atom utilization, and good selectivity etc. [
9
,
10
]. Extensive studies have also been conducted with a focus on innovative syntheses and applications toward ORR [
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
]. Recently, Fei et al. reported a general method to synthesize a series of monodispersed atomic transition metals (M = Fe, Co, Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene with a common MN4C4 moiety [
15
]. Wan and coworkers developed a cascade anchoring strategy for mass production of single-atomic metal-nitrogen catalysts with a high loading of metal up to 12.1 wt.% [
16
]. A simple ionothermal method was also developed to fabricate highly reactive and stable single-atom ORR catalysts, atomically dispersed Fe-Nx species on porous porphyrinic triazine-based frameworks with high Fe loading up to 8.3 wt.% [
17
]. Besides improving the intrinsic activity by engineering single-atomic M-Nx moiety, creating a high concentration of defects as active sites in carbon-based materials will further elevate the ORR electrochemical process [
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]
]. Yao’s group reported that carbon defects could introduce unsaturated carbon atoms with dangling bonds and reshape the local electronic structure, thus improving the electrocatalytic activity [
21
]. Liu et al. suggested that the defect sites with dangling bonds would react with oxygen after exposure to air, resulting in oxygen functionalization and enhancement of catalytic activities [
22
]. Despite the tremendous progress in single-atomically dispersed M-Nx on carbon materials, there is still a large niche to further lower the cost of carbon precursors as well as to simplify the processing procedures.
As a type of environmental-friendly and low-cost raw materials, biomass usually contains abundant nonmetal elements (e.g. N, P, and S) as well as trace amount of metal elements, such as Fe, Cu and Ni [
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
]. It is expectable that ingenious design and engineering can transform biomass to single-atomic M-Nx-contained carbon materials with high-performance ORR activity. Herein, we report a template strategy to synthesize carbon-based electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed Fe-N4 moiety sited nearby graphitic edges (E-FeNC) by coupling the intrinsic Fe from Fe-containing protein in biomass and abundant anchoring sites from decomposition of dicyanamide. The synergistic effect between the single-atomic Fe-N4 active site and neighbored carbon edges boosts the ORR dissociation, leading to improved ORR activity. When used in ZABs, the typical E-FeNC shows high specific capacity and power density as well as stability, demonstrating a promising alternative to commercial Pt/C.
All the E-FeNC samples were synthesized through a facile one-step pyrolysis of the mixture of flour, dicyanamide and colloidal silica (HUDOX HS-40, ALDRICH). Typically, dicyanamide, flour and colloidal silica solution were mixed with a mass ratio of x: 1: 4 in 40 mL deionized water under stirring to form uniform solution. The solution was followed by drying under heating temperature of 110 °C. Then, the obtained white precursor was carbonized in a corundum boat with cover at certain temperature for 2 h in Ar atmosphere. After cooling down to room temperature, the product was soaked in 2.0 M hot sodium hydroxide solution to remove the template and then washed by deionized water to remove impurities. The product was named as E-FeNC-x-T (x is the mass ration of dicyanamide: flour, T represents the carbonized temperature). FeNC sample (no use of colloidal silica) and E-NC sample (no use of dicyanamide) were synthesized under the same condition at the optimized 900 °C, which are regarded as the control samples.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted to determine the crystallographic structure with a Cu Kα (λ = 0.15405 nm) radiation source. Raman spectrometry was tested on a Raman spectrometer with a laser wavelength of 532 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a Al Kα (hʋ =1486.6 eV) radiation source. N2 sorption isotherms obtained at 77 K with an ASAP 2010 and samples would be degassed at 300 °C in vacuum for 3 h. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-5610) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 F). The iron content in E-FeNC sample was tested on the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on the Agilent 7500ce ICP-OES. The X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (Fe K-edge) were collected at BL14W1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation facility (SSRF). The electron beam energy was 3.5 GeV and the stored current was 240 mA (top-up). A 38-pole wiggler with the maximum magnetic field of 1.2 T inserted in the straight section of the storage ring was used.
Electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV), rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements, rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) measurements and chronoamperometric (CA) measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Pine Instrument Co.). All measurements were performed in a three-electrode system with the electrolyte of 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution or in 0.1 M HClO4 solution. Because alkaline solution causes the leaching of glass constituents into electrolyte [
27
], data collection was completed within 2 h since the initial exposure of electrolyte to the glass cell [
28
]. A Pt foil and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) were used as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. Rotating disk electrode (RDE, 0.19625 cm2 geometric surface area of glassy carbon) or rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE, 0.2475 cm2 geometric surface area of glassy carbon and 0.1866 cm2 of Pt ring) coated with active materials was used as working electrode, respectively. Experimentally, the catalyst ink was prepared by adding 5 mg active material into a 250 μL deionized water, 250 μL ethanol and 25 μL Nafion (5 wt.%) solution and then the solution was sonicated for an hour to form homogeneous ink. Then, 10 μL in. was dropped on the surface of electrode and dried at 50 °C to form a thin film. Commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C was prepared in the same way for comparison. And the potentials vs. SCE were converted to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. The conversion was calculated based on the equation as follows:
(1)
ERHE = ESCE + 0.0591 × pH + 0.2415
Before formal testing, the electrode was activated in CV measurement for 100 cycles with the scan rate of 100 mV s−1. And the O2-saturated electrolyte was kept introducing O2 with a rate of 200 mL min−1 during the test. RRDE measurements were taken to evaluate the electron transfer number (n) and peroxide yields during ORR catalytic process. Equations are listed as follows [
29
]:
(2)
(3)
where Ir (A) is the ring current, Id (A) is the disk current and N is the current collection efficiency of the Pt ring electrode.
The kinetic current density (JK) was calculated by using the equation JK = JL·J/(JL − J) at 0.9 or 0.85 V vs RHE, where JL is the limiting diffusion current density, and J is the current density at a specific potential in the mixed-kinetic region. The electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) were also estimated via the formula (ECSA = Cdl/Cs), where Cdl is the double layer capacitance obtained from the slope of the linear fitting of capacitive currents vs. scan rates, and Cs is the specific capacitance of the sample (adopted as 0.04 m F cm−2 here) [
30
,
31
] or the capacitance of an atomically smooth planar surface of the material per unit area under identical electrolyte conditions.
First-principle DFT calculations were performed by using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). Projector augmented plane wave (PAW) method was adopted. The cutoff energy of 400 eV was used to expand the plane wave basis and the generalized gradient approximation was applied for the electron exchange correlations. Large supercells were adopted to minimize the undesirable ghost interactions between the FeN4 images under the cyclic boundary condition. The Brillouin zone integration was performed using only the Γ point due to its large system size. The Brillouin zone was sampled with Monkhorst-Pack 3 × 3×1 k-points generated automatically. We set the thickness of a vacuum to 15 Å in the z axis for the models in order to avoid interaction reaction between nearby slabs. In geometry optimization, the convergences of force and energy were set to 0.02 eV/Å and 1 × 10−5 eV, respectively.
The pathways on FeN4 with or without graphitic edges were calculated in detail according to electrochemical framework developed by Nørskov and co-workers [
32
,
33
]. For the ORR in an alkaline electrolyte (pH = 13), as H2O/H3O+ may act as the proton donor, the overall reaction scheme of the ORR can be expressed as:
(4)
The ORR can proceed through the following elementary steps usually employed to investigate the electrocatalysis of the ORR on various materials:
(5)
(6)
(7)
(8)
where * stands for an active site on the catalytic surface, (l) and (g) refer to liquid and gas phases, respectively.
The free energy ΔG of each step is obtained by the following equation:
(9)
where ΔE, ΔEZPE, and ΔS represent the different intermediate energy, zero-point energy changes, and entropy of the reaction, respectively. ΔE was obtained from DFT calculations, and ΔEZPE is zero-point energy of each adsorbate or free molecules calculated by the vibrational frequency of each adsorbed species, T is the temperature, and ΔS is the entropy change. Entropy values of gaseous molecules can be taken from the standard tables in the Physical Chemistry text book [
34
], while the entropies of adsorbate and adsorption site are negligible.
The bias effect on the free energy of each initial, intermediate and final state involving electrons transfer in the electrode is also taken into account by shifting the energy of the state by:
(10)
where U is the electrode applied potential, e is the transferred charge and n is the number of proton-electron transferred pairs.
The change of free energy owing to the effect of pH value of the electrolyte is considered by the correction of H+ ions concentration ([H+]) dependence of the entropy
(11)
where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.
Primary ZAB was tested by using a home-made electrochemical cell, where a polished zinc plate and 6.0 M KOH were employed as the anode and electrolyte, respectively. The E-FeNC catalyst coated on carbon paper electrode (1 cm2, catalyst loading 1 mg) was used as the cathode. To assemble rechargeable ZABs, NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) were prepared by a hydrothermal method [
35
]. Briefly, 0.5 mmol Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.5 mmol Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, and 5 mmol CO(NH2)2 were dissolved in 30 mL water under constant agitation for 1 h and transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. Thereafter, the autoclave was sealed tightly and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the resultant NiFe-LDH powder was washed by water, dried at 60 °C for 12 h.
Scheme 1
depicts the fabrication of carbon-based materials with edge-sited Fe-N-C active sites (E-FeNC) by mixing dicyanamide, flour and colloidal silica in water. Flour contains a high proportion of starch and protein, which are a subset of complex carbohydrates also known as polysaccharides. Moreover, the hydrophilic character ensures its excellent dispersibility in water. After stirring and drying, the uniform silica spheres as templates were homogeneously coated by gelatinized flour and dicyanamide. Then, the carbonization of the mixture was performed in Ar atmosphere at different temperatures (T °C). During the pyrolysis process, dicyanamide firstly transforms into sheet-like g-C3N4 (550–710 °C) [
26
], which acts as in situ templates for flour to form graphene-like structure and provides anchor sites for Fe atoms from protein in flour. Subsequently, the heat-treated mixture transforms to N-doped carbon with Fe-N4 moiety and high graphitization degree. Finally, carbon materials with abundant edge-sited Fe-N-C active centers (E-FeNC) were harvested after removing the silica in 2.0 M hot NaOH solution.
Scheme 1. Illustration of the synthesis of carbon-based materials with edge-sited FeNC active sites (E-FeNC).
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in
Fig. 1
a reveals the morphology of a typical E-FeNC sample, which was obtained at 900 °C from the precursor with dicyanamide/flour mass ratio of 1:1. It is noted that it has interconnected porous structure and the pore size is in the range of 7−10 nm, which can be attributed to the gelatinization effect of flour and the function of silica templates. All the as-prepared samples derived from the precursors containing silica, display the similar honeycomb-like porous structure, irrespective of the calcination temperature and the ratio of precursors, such as E-FeNC-800, 1000, 1100, and E-NC in Fig. S1. In contrast, without the silica spheres in the precursors, no obvious porosity was observed in FeNC (Fig. S1e). Such feature is further corroborated by the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms as shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1. The surface area, pore size and total pore volume of E-FeNC is 1168 m2 g−1, 7.8 nm, and 2.65 cm3 g−1, respectively. The t-plot method was used to calculate the micropore area and volume, which are 48.98 m2 g-1 and 0.02 cm3 g-1, suggesting that there are tiny amount of micropores, only contributing ∼4 % surface area to the total one. This result demonstrates that the mesopores dominate in the samples and contribute to most specific surface areas. TEM image (
Fig. 1
b) further confirmed the uniform porous structure of E-FeNC with luxuriant edges. Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns display clear polycrystalline diffraction rings corresponding to (100) and (200) facets, demonstrating a certain degree of graphitization, which agrees well with x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S3). For comparison, E-NC derived from the precursor with the absence of dicyanamide shows much weak diffraction rings and peaks (Fig. S4), suggesting a low graphitization degree. From the Raman spectra (Fig. S5), the ratio ID/IG (1.11) of E-FeNC is lower than that of E-NC (1.17) and higher than that of FeNC (1.06), further confirming the relatively high graphitization degree from the inducing effect of intermediate g-C3N4. Elemental mapping presented in
Fig. 1
c primarily shows the existence of N dopant as well as O element distributing uniformly in the carbon skeleton, but no remarkable Fe element signals were detected, which is consistent with x-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) in Fig. S6 and Table S2. The N content in E-FeNC, FeNC, and E-NC is 8.70, 4.09, and 2.81 at.% in sequence. Among these three samples, E-FeNC exhibits the highest N content due to the contribution from both dicyanamide and flour.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image in
Fig. 1
d shows clearly graphitic structure consisting of few layers as marked by the dotted line, which mainly stems from the in situ formed sheet-like g-C3N4 during the pyrolysis of dicyanamide. The lattice distance is about 0.342 nm, a little larger than the value of graphite (0.335 nm), which could be caused by the N doping or curly edges inheriting from the silica spheres as marked by the white lines. The pores with diameters ranging from 4 to 10 nm as marked by the dotted circles provide abundant edges, which is expected to improve the ORR performance [
36
]. In
Fig. 1
e, high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image reveals that individual Fe atoms exhibiting bright contrast disperse around the edge of a pore (dark area marked by the white dotted line). The weak signal acquired by electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in
Fig. 1
f identifies N and Fe in the local area marked by a white square in
Fig. 1
e. It is difficult to determine the valence state of the individual Fe from EELS, but a possible structure can be envisioned as shown in the inset of
Fig. 1
f based on the previous reports [
37
,
38
].
Moreover, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were performed to probe the valence state and configuration of Fe. The XANES curve of E-FeNC in
Fig. 1
g shows near-edge absorption energy between those of Fe2O3 and Fe foil, which implies the existence of Fe single atoms carrying positive charges [
38
]. Meanwhile, the pre-edge peak of E-FeNC, located at 7132.6 eV between Fe foil (7131.4 eV) and Fe2O3 (7133.7 eV), indicates that the main Fe species are Fe2+ ions. This feature is also the characteristic of a square-planar configuration with high D4h symmetry, due to a 1s → 4pz shakedown transition. Fourier transform (FT) EXAFS curve of E-FeNC shows a main peak at about 1.4 Å in
Fig. 1
h, which could be attributed to Fe-N coordination in the first shell. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) shows that Fe content in E-FeNC is 0.32 wt.%, while the content in FeNC and E-NC is 0.37 and 0.07 wt.%, respectively. In
Fig. 1
i, 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum measured at 293 K was fitted with two doublets, D1 (Fe(II)N4, low spin) and D2 (Fe(II)N2+2, intermediate spin), which were assigned to square-planar Fe(II)N4 coordination with atomic Fe(II) (Table S3) [
39
,
40
]. D1 is the well-known active site for ORR in catalysts obtained by heat-treating supported or unsupported porphyrins. But there is no doublet D3 (N-FeN2+2/C, high spin) to be detected, which is also regarded as active sites for ORR [
41
]. In addition, neither sextet nor singlet corresponding to α-Fe or γ-Fe was observed, suggesting the absence of zero-valent Fe crystalline phases [
42
].
The electrochemical performance of all samples toward ORR was tested in a three-electrode system in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of E-FeNC and E-NC show more distinct reduction peaks than that of FeNC as shown in
Fig. 2
a, because the larger specific surface area is beneficial for exposing more active sites and contributes a lot to the capacitance [
43
]. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were firstly performed in a rotating disk electrode (RDE) to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity as shown in
Figs. 2
b and S7. And E-FeNC exhibits half-wave potential of 0.875 V as positive as that of Pt/C (0.859 V) and higher limiting current density (5.27 mA cm−2) than Pt/C (5.35 mA cm−2) at 0.4 V, demonstrating the best performance among all the as-prepared samples. In contrast, E-NC shows the half-wave potential of 0.660 V and current density of 1.95 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V, which is much worse than the FeNC with the half-wave potential of 0.837 V vs RHE with the current density of 4.29 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V (
Fig. 2
b). The kinetic current density (JK) of E-FeNC at 0.9 V vs RHE is calculated to 2.53 mA cm−2, which is 1.62-fold that of Pt/C (1.56 mA cm−2) and four times that of FeNC (0.64 mA cm−2). At 0.85 V, the JK of E-FeNC is 7.95 mA cm−2, more than three times of that of Pt/C (2.49 mA cm−2). Based on the double layer capacitance (Cdl) (Fig. S9), the calculated ECSA of E-FeNC is 158.25 cm2, much larger than that of E-NC (57.5 cm2), FeNC (39.5 cm2) and Pt/C (48.8 cm2), indicating the exposure of more active sites. As shown in
Fig. 2
c, Tafel plots of E-FeNC, FeNC, E-NC and Pt/C were obtained in the kinetic region of O2 reduction from corresponding LSV curves. E-FeNC exhibits a low Tafel slope of 62 mV dec-1, even smaller than Pt/C (64 mV dec-1), indicating the fast reactant diffusion to active sites [
44
]. RRDE measurements were taken to evaluate the electron transfer number (n) and peroxide yields during ORR catalytic process. E-FeNC shows the lower ring current density compared with FeNC and E-NC, but higher than that of Pt/C in Fig. S8, showing the same trend as illustrated in
Fig. 2
b. Based on the RRDE measurements, the electron transfer number was calculated to be 3.71–3.91 for E-FeNC, 2.62–2.85 for E-NC, 3.65–3.90 for FeNC, 3.96–3.98 for Pt/C in the potential range from 0.1 to 0.8 V vs RHE, as shown in
Fig. 2
d. It can be found that a four-electron pathway dominates the ORR in E-FeNC and FeNC, but mixed two- and four-electron pathways in E-NC. The peroxide yields of E-FeNC are lower than 9.9 % in the whole potential range, which can be attributed to the nearly four-electron pathway. In contrast, the yields of FeNC and E-NC are as high as 32.9 % and 61.1 %, respectively. Long-time stability and methanol tolerance are vital factors in commercial application. As shown in
Fig. 2
e (up panel), E-FeNC exhibits the superior resistance for methanol compared with Pt/C. When adding 3.0 M methanol into alkaline solution, the current density of Pt/C declined sharply, but such phenomenon did not happened to E-FeNC. The chronoamperometric measurement was also performed to evaluate long-time stability of E-FeNC as shown in
Fig. 2
e (down panel). E-FeNC remains 91.4 % of its original current density after 20000 s, whereas the current density of Pt/C only retains 78.5 %. These results indicate that E-FeNC possesses superior stability and tolerance in methanol toward ORR, demonstrating a promising electrocatalyst in the practical application. As summarized in
Fig. 2
f, LSV curves suggest that the samples derived from the precursor with dicyanamide/flour mass ratio of 1:1 at 900 °C possesses much better electrocatalytic performance than others, in terms of onset potential and half-wave potential. The catalytic performance of E-FeNC in 0.1 M HClO4 solution was also estimated as shown in Fig. S10. The E-FeNC shows superior performance to E-NC and FeNC, but inferior to commercial Pt/C. The half-wave potential is 91 mV less positive than that of Pt/C.

To gain more insight into the excellent electrocatalytic activity of E-FeNC, spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed on the basis of the experimental observations. As shown in Fig. S11, two models with edges or not were proposed to elucidate the role of edges in influencing the electronic nature of the atomic sites and consequently the ORR energetics. For the Fe-N4 moiety near a graphitic edge (
Fig. 3
a), the binding energy (−0.91 eV) of Fe atom with O2 molecule in the side-on configuration is larger than that of Fe atom with O2 molecule in the end-on configuration (−0.82 eV), demonstrating that the former configuration is more favorable. In contrast, the Fe-N4 moiety embedded in a perfect graphitic plane shows a preferential end-on adsorption configuration with a binding energy of −0.73 eV, larger than the value of −0.62 eV with the side-on configuration (
Fig. 3
b). As a result, the original bond length of O2 molecule (1.232 Å) increases to 1.391 Å upon the side-on form in the E-FeNC model, while the length of O2 molecule increases to 1.298 Å upon the end-on adsorption in the perfect FeNC configuration. The bond length of Fe-O (1.839 and 1.846 Å) in the E-FeNC is also a little larger than that in FeNC configuration (1.837 Å). The larger elongation of bond length weakens the OO bond, promoting the dissociation of oxygenous intermediates, while the larger Fe-O length facilitates the desorption of final intermediates from the FeN4 moiety. The calculated ORR free energy diagrams in
Fig. 3
c show that the hydrogenation of *O2 to form *OOH is energetically least favorable on E-FeNC (0.582 eV), which is most likely the thermodynamic rate determining step (RDS). The subsequent HOOH dissociation is exothermic with the reaction energy of 0.652 eV, highly promoting the 4e reduction process, in which the OO bond must be split during the course of the reaction. In contrast, FeNC shows the highest reaction energy requirement for the hydrogenation of *O (0.705 eV), implying that the formation of *OH is the RDS. The elongated OO bond followed by the HOOH dissociation pathway is mainly due to the charge transfer among Fe, N and C atoms as illustrated in
Figs. 3
d and S12. Compared with the charge density distribution in the perfect FeNC model (
Figs. 3
e and S13), the two edge C atoms break the symmetry of charge distribution [
45
,
46
]. When the O2 molecule chemisorbs on the FeN4 moiety, the charge transfer will occur from Fe-3d orbitals to O2-2p anti-bonding orbitals and the resultant decrease in bond order of the O2 molecule. Moreover, the two nearby edge C atoms with dangling bonds form a partial bond and thus would energetically stabilize the side-on configuration [
47
]. This is further confirmed by the computed electronic density of states (DOS) of Fe-3d orbitals as shown in
Fig. 3
f. Compared to the orbitals of FeNC, the spin down orbitals of E-FeNC are filled near the Fermi level (EF), which would provide the electrons transferred to O2 molecules.

As a proof-of-concept, performance of the primary Zn-air battery was measured in an electrochemical cell, in which the typical E-FeNC was used as a cathode and polished Zn foil as the anode in 6.0 M KOH [
48
].
Fig. 4
a shows that the open circuit voltage (OCV) for the typical E-FeNC and 20 wt.% commercial Pt/C is 1.45 and 1.46 V, respectively. For the E-FeNC, at 20 and 100 mA cm−2 of discharge current densities, the voltage still remains high values of 1.25 and 0.94 V, respectively. During the galvanostatic discharge process at 50 mA cm−2, the specific capacity of the typical E-FeNC is 710 mA h g-1 normalized to the mass of consumed Zn (
Fig. 4
b), corresponding to gravimetric energy density of 660.3 Wh kg−1. For comparison, the Pt/C catalyst exhibits the capacity of 491.7 mA h g−1, corresponding to gravimetric energy densities of 442.5 Wh kg−1. At a voltage of 1.0 V, E-FeNC shows a high current density of 97 mA cm−2. The peak power density for E-FeNC is 151.6 mW cm−2, while the value for Pt/C is 121.5 mW cm−2 (

Fig. 4
e. Rechargabe ZABs were assembled by coupling E-FeNC and LDH as bifunctional electrocatalyst, as shown in
Fig. 4
f. The E-FeNC-based ZAB shows a slightly lower charge-discharge voltage gap than the ZAB using commercial electrocatlysts (Pt/C and RuO2), especially after 100 h as shown in
Fig. 4
g. Remarkably, the ZAB with E-FeNC and LDH exhibits excellent cycling stability as evidenced by 400 charge/discharge cycles over a period of 200 h at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 (
Fig. 4
h), which is much better than the ZAB with Pt/C and RuO2. Therefore, the typical E-FeNC shows higher specific capacity and power density than Pt/C. And it could be a potential alternative to commercial Pt/C in the practical ZAB application.

In summary, non-precious carbon materials with Fe-N4 moiety sited near the abundant edges were tactfully synthesized by using the biomass flour as carbon and Fe source, dicyanamide-derived g-C3N4 as anchor sites, and silica spheres as templates. The interaction of atomic Fe-N4 moiety and graphitic edges synergistically modulate the charge transfer during the ORR and result in an energetically favorable side-on adsorption configuration with an elongated OO bond length, boosting the subsequent 4e− reaction pathway. Compared to commercial Pt/C catalyst, the E-FeNC shows more positive half-wave potential (0.875 V vs RHE), larger current density (5.27 mA cm−2 at 0.4 V), and better methanol crossover effect and long-time stability. When used in Zn-air battery, the E-FeNC electrocatalyst at the air electrode shows high specific capacity of 710 mA h g−1, power density of 151.6 mW cm−2 and long-lasting 200 -hs rechargeability by coupling with LDH. From the design of material synthesis to the superior electrochemical performance, this work might shed light on the future development of cost-effective electrocatalyst toward ORR, thereby facilitating the large-scale applications in fuel cells and zinc-air batteries with high power and high energy.
