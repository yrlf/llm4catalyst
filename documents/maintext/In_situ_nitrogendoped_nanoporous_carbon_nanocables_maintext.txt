{'Abstract': 'A new N-doped carbon nanomaterial with nanoporous coaxial nanocable structure was designed for achieving the requirements of high nitrogen content, proper nitrogen bonding state, and sufficient electron and mass transportation for an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. The nanoporous sheaths provided more catalytic sites and allowed oxygen and reactants to easily access them for fast mass transfer, whereas carbon nanotube cores provided a three-dimensional conductive network and guaranteed fast electron transfer. As a result, the designed low-cost catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance and is one of the most active metal-free ORR catalyst.', '1. Introduction': 'With the progress in tuning intrinsic properties of carbon material with a series of heteroatoms, such as B,15 N,16,17 S,18 P,19 plenty of doped carbon catalysts, including dual-doped20,21 and multiply-doped carbon materials,22 had been reported, although their catalytic mechanism is still unclear.23,24 Among doped carbon catalysts, N-doped ones are the most popular. In general, N-doped metal-free carbon catalysts are prepared mainly through three different routes. First route is in situ introduction of nitrogen atom into carbon framework upon the formation of graphitic plane via processes like chemical vapor deposition (CVD).25–27 This approach is often able to provide high nitrogen content in carbon materials, but it is not practical for mass production of the catalysts for commercial applications. Second route is post-heating graphitic carbon, including carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene and fullerene, with nitrogen-containing substances.28–30 Because of incorporation resistance from pre-existing graphitic structure, the nitrogen fraction is usually too insufficient to develop enough catalytic sites. The last route is direct pyrolysis of nitrogen-rich precursors, such as graphitic carbon nitride,31 melamine foam32 and polymer framework.33,34 However, the low electron conductivity of the materials obtained through this approach does not favor electrocatalytic process.\nThe design of cheap and stable catalysts for ORR is still a challenge, although tremendous effort has been made in this area. For viability, the activities of these catalysts should at least approach that of traditional but more expensive Pt/C catalysts. Therefore, the rational design of N-doped carbon materials as efficient metal-free ORR catalysts for practical applications needs to meet the following requirements: (1) high content of nitrogen in appropriate chemical bonding state to make as many catalytically active sites as possible for boosting activity; (2) sufficient electron conductivity to favor electron transfer, especially in practical fuel cell applications; and (3) easy access to catalytically active sites and fast mass transfer (ORR occurs at solid–liquid–gas three-phase-interface, which requires that the reactants can easily access the active sites of catalysts).\nTaking into account these requirements, we designed a new N-doped carbon material with nanoporous coaxial nanocable structure as metal-free ORR catalyst. The nanoporous carbon sheath not only imparts high surface area to the catalyst, but also allows the reactants to easily access the catalytically active sites and facilitates mass transfer. More importantly, the N-doping was achieved in situ during the formation of nanopores at high temperature, which allow us to achieve high concentration of N-doping. The carbon nanotube cores provide a three-dimensional conductive network and guarantee sufficient electron conductivity for fast electron transfer. Moreover, N-doping in high concentration on porous sheath, instead of directly on carbon nanotube core, will alleviate the damage of doping on carbon nanotube core and thus ensure good conductivity in these materials. As a result, the designed catalyst showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for ORR comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts, as well as better durability and tolerance to methanol.', '2. Experimental': 'Synthesis of CNT@NPC\nCharacterization\nElectrochemical tests\nElectrochemical experiments were conducted in a standard three-electrode cell at room temperature on PARSTAT 2273 advanced electrochemical system. The cell consisted of a working electrode with catalyst, Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum foil as counter electrode. All CV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The polarization curves were recorded in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Before each test, the electrolyte was purged with O2 for at least 30 min to achieve O2 saturated solution. RDE measurements were conducted at different rotating speeds from 400 to 3600 rpm by using CTV101 Speed Control Unit (France Radiometer Analytical S.A.).\nCalculation for electron transfer number', '3. Results and discussion': 'The morphology of the product was first investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The typical SEM image (Fig. 1b) shows that the product after hydrothermal coating process maintains morphologies similar to CNTs with smooth surfaces except for a larger average diameter (ca. 150 nm vs. 50 nm), indicating the successful and uniform coating of carbonaceous layer on CNTs. The TEM image in Fig. 1c evidences that the product has coaxial cable-like structures. The inner part can be attributed to CNTs. The apparent image contrast difference between inner and outer parts clearly reveals that the entire surfaces of all CNTs are uniformly coated with a ca. 50 nm thick sheath. After the pyrolysis at 900 °C, SEM image in Fig. 1d shows that the morphology of the product (designated as CNT@NPC-900) does not change much except for the shrinked diameter, which can be ascribed to the decomposition and gasification of organic component in carbonaceous sheath. TEM image in Fig. 1e confirms that the carbonized sheath became thinner (ca. 25 nm vs. 50 nm) and uniformly coated on the entire outer surface of CNTs. The slightly light image contrast in sheath part indicates that this layer does not have fully graphitized structure like CNTs. High-resolution TEM image in Fig. 1f clearly reveals the lattice fringes in inner part with a distance of ca. 0.34 nm, matching well with the interplanar distance of (002) planes of CNTs, as well as somewhat disordered outer sheath, corresponding to the carbonized coating layer. In order to investigate the effect of pyrolysis temperature on the morphologies and performance of the products, the products were also pyrolyzed at 800 and 1000 °C, which are denoted as CNT@NPC-800 and CNT@NPC-1000 hereinafter, respectively. As shown in Fig. S1,† the SEM and TEM observation suggests all products presented similar morphologies and structures except for a slight thickness shift in sheath layer (30–40 nm for CNT@NPC-800 and 10–20 nm for CNT@NPC-1000), which is consistent with the change of pyrolysis temperature. Interestingly, it should also be noted that the ends of many CNTs in all three samples did not fully coat with carbon layer and exposed CNT tips, as marked in orange circles in Fig. 1c and S2.† These exposed CNT tips could enhance the role of three-dimensional conductive network of CNTs in catalysts and facilitate the electron migration.\nThe surface area and porosity are important parameters for ORR catalysts since high surface area would provide more catalytic sites and high porosity would benefit mass transfer. Therefore, the surface area and porosity of the products were further characterized by nitrogen isothermal adsorption technique. The adsorption–desorption isotherms of sample CNT@NPC-900, shown in Fig. 1g, exhibits a typical hysteresis of a nanoporous system, indicating that these nanocables contain nanoporous structures. The total specific surface area according to Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis is 413 m2 g−1, which is much larger than that of pristine acid-treatment CNTs of 79.5 m2 g−1 (Fig. S3a†). The dramatic increase in surface area can only be ascribed to the porous carbon sheath. Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore-size distribution analysis (inset in Fig. 1g) reveals that the diameters of most pores in the sheath lie in the range from 1.7 nm to 4 nm, which should be large enough for free diffusion of oxygen molecules with a kinetic diameter of 0.34 nm.36 The data of BET analysis of sample CNT@NPC-800 and CNT@NPC-1000 are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S3.† It can be seen that BET surface area was dramatically enhanced approximately four times (79.5 vs. 413 m2 g−1) when the pyrolysis temperature increased from 800 °C to 900 °C, and slightly increased as temperature further increased to 1000 °C.\nIt was reported that the nitrogen content and chemical bonding state play an important role in electrocatalytic activity of N-doped catalysts for ORR.17,24,37,38 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed to determine the composition of the as-produced CNT@NPCs and analyze the bonding state of nitrogen in each sample. As presented in Fig. 2a, XPS spectra recorded of all three samples exhibit obvious N signals, confirming that nitrogen was successfully introduced into the product. No signals of any other element in full scan range demonstrate that the catalysts are free of metal.\nMoreover, it can be seen that the intensity of nitrogen signal decreases significantly when the pyrolysis temperature reaches 1000 °C, indicating the appreciable decrease in nitrogen content. The quantitative analysis listed in Table 1 reveals that the nitrogen content in CNT@NPC-800 is as high as 15.76%, which is the highest value reported for N-doped carbon catalysts,36 to the best of our knowledge. Even when pyrolyzed at 900 °C, the sample CNT@NPC-900 still has 6.93% nitrogen, higher than other N-doped carbon materials (2–5%).31,35 The achievement of high nitrogen content can be attributed to the synchronous and in situ N-doping during the formation of nanoporous carbon sheath with high surface area. At higher pyrolysis temperatures, lesser nitrogen remaining in the sample is possible since more organic moieties and melamine (nitrogen source) will be decomposed and evaporated at higher temperature. Furthermore, by comparing the high-resolution N 1s peaks of three samples shown in Fig. 2b–d, it can be seen that the shapes of peaks are apparently different, indicating that the bonding states of nitrogen are different in the three samples. In order to further investigate the bonding state of nitrogen, the N 1s signals in each spectrum were deconvoluted into the components corresponding to pyridinic-type, pyrrolic-type, and quaternary-type nitrogen. The binding energy for each type of N is selected according to previous reports24 and summarized in Table S1.† The result of quantitative analysis, summarized in Table 1, clearly reveals that pyrrolic-N dominates in sample CNT@NPC-800, while quaternary-N dominates in sample CNT@NPC-900 and CNT@NPC-1000.\nThe electrocatalytic performance of N-doped nanoporous carbon nanocables was firstly evaluated by carrying out three-electrode cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments in O2-free and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Compared with the featureless CV curves recorded in N2-saturated (O2-free) solution (dotted line), distinct ORR peaks recorded in O2-saturated electrolyte suggested that all the catalysts are active for oxygen reduction (Fig. 3a). The ORR onset potential for CNT@NPC-900 was about −0.114 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, all potential will be relative to Ag/AgCl unless specifically illustrated hereinafter), which is more positive than that for CNT@NPC-800 and CNT@NPC-1000, indicating better activity for ORR. The electrocatalytic activities for ORR of three samples were further investigated via linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments by using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) and compared to commercial Johnson-Matthey (JM) Pt/C catalysts (20 wt% Pt loading). As shown in Fig. 3b, CNT@NPC-900 showed the best performance with the most positive half-wave potential (E1/2, viz. a potential at which the current is half of the limiting current in LSV curve, which was commonly used to assess ORR catalysts) of −0.184 V. This value is only 42 mV negative to E1/2 of 20% Pt/C (−0.142 V). It should be noted that the minimum activity requirement for non-Pt electrocatalysts for possible replacement of platinum is that the non-Pt catalysts should have activity at 0.800 V (vs. RHE), comparable to Pt catalysts at 0.900 V (vs. RHE), under the condition that catalyst layer on electrode is not too thick.39 This is the reason why most Pt-free catalysts are evaluated at −0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M KOH solution; therefore, the present catalyst was evaluated at this potential. It can be seen that the mass current density for CNT@NPC-900 at −0.2 V reached 8.43 mA mg−1, which is close to 11.9 mA mgPt+C−1 for commercial 20% Pt/C at −0.1 V. Table S2† summarizes the electrocatalytic performance of metal-free nitrogen-doped catalysts recently reported in the literature. It can be seen that the present CNT@NPC-900 catalyst is most active for ORR in terms of more positive onset potential and half-wave potential. These results show that the present catalyst of CNT@NPC-900 showed excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR and can potentially be used as a Pt-free catalyst candidate for fuel cell applications.\nOn the other hand, it should be noted that CNT@NPC-900 showed much better ORR activity than the other two samples (CNT@NPC-800 and CNT@NPC-1000), which could be justified by the nitrogen doping level and the activity difference in different types of nitrogen species. It has been reported that the nitrogen content in N-doped carbon materials is positively related to their ORR activity; and the quaternary-N and pyridinic-N are more active than pyrrolic-N for ORR.24,37,38 Since the nitrogen content in CNT@NPC-900 is almost two times than that in CNT@NPC-1000 (6.93% vs. 3.54%), the former exhibited better ORR activity. Although the nitrogen content in CNT@NPC-800 is highest, the fraction of more active nitrogen species is much lower than that in CNT@NPC-900 as shown in Table 1. The surface area and pore volume of CNT@NPC-800 are one-fifth and three-fifth that of CNT@NPC-900, indicating the less exposed catalytically active sites and the worse mass transfer in the former. The pore volume is 0.272 cm3 g−1 for CNT@NPC-800 and 0.443 cm3 g−1 for CNT@NPC-900. Moreover, taking into account the possibly worse conductivity of porous carbon sheath due to the less graphitization at lower temperature, CNT@NPC-800 exhibited worse ORR activity than CNT@NPC-900.\nTo gain further insight into the electron transfer process in ORR catalyzed by the studied catalysts, we carried out a serial of LSV measurements on three samples at different rotating speeds of RDE (Fig. S4†). Fig. 3c presented the Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots at −0.45 V calculated from LSV curves at various rotating speeds based on Koutecky–Levich equation. The K–L lines for CNT@NPC-900 and CNT@NPC-800 are in parallel with that for Pt/C, indicating that ORR occurs on them in a similar way as that on Pt/C. Accurate electron transfer numbers (n) at various potentials were calculated through K–L equation and plotted in Fig. 3d. It can be inferred that ORR takes place on CNT@NPC-900 catalyst in more efficient and beneficial four-electron (4e) reaction pathway, while it occurs in a combined pathway of 2e and 4e reductions in CNT@NPC-1000 catalyst.\nIt should be noted that the ratios of CNTs, porous carbon sheath precursor (glucose) and nitrogen-rich precursor (melamine) used in the preparation of catalysts will also affect the activities of catalysts. First, the influence of the ratio of CNTs and porous carbon sheath precursor (glucose) on the electrocatalytic performance of final CNT@NPC catalysts was evaluated. Three catalysts were prepared in parallel at the same conditions as that for CNT@NPC-900 except for the different mass ratios of CNTs and glucose in hydrothermal processing (1:20, 1:40, and 1:80). This change affected the thickness of the nanoporous carbon sheath. TEM images in Fig. 4a and b and 1e show that the thicknesses of the carbonized porous sheath are ∼9 nm, ∼25 nm and ∼65 nm for the catalysts prepared at the ratio of 1:20, 1:40 (Fig. 1e) and 1:80, respectively. The polarization curves of these three catalysts shown in Fig. 4c indicated that the catalyst prepared at the ratio of 1:40 had more positive onset potential and half-wave potential and thus better catalytic activity than other two catalysts. The inferior activity for the catalyst (1:20) could be because the thinner nanoporous sheath with lower surface area provided a lower amount of sites for N-doping and thus produced less catalytic sites for ORR. On the other hand, if the sheath was too thick, like situation in the catalyst (1:80), the electron transport via conductive CNT core would not be efficient since the electron conductivity of the nanoporous sheath was much worse than that of CNT core. This speculation was consistent with the results indicated by the shapes of polarization curves in Fig. 4c. Therefore, 1:40 was chosen as the mass ratio of CNTs and nitrogen-free precursor (glucose). Second, the influence of the ratio of CNT@NPC precursor (the product of the hydrothermal process) and nitrogen-rich precursor (melamine) was further investigated. Three catalysts prepared in parallel at the same conditions as that for CNT@NPC-900 except for the different mass ratios of CNT@NPC precursor and melamine (1:5, 1:10, and 1:20) were evaluated. The polarization curves of these three catalysts shown in Fig. 4d indicated that the catalyst (1:10) had more positive onset potential and half-wave potential and thus better catalytic activity than the catalyst (1:5). This could be because a lower amount of nitrogen-rich precursor led to the insufficient N-doping and thus a lower amount of catalytically active sites for ORR. The activity of the catalyst (1:10) was comparable to the catalyst (1:20). In the consideration of using less chemicals for low cost, 1:10 was chosen as the mass ratio of CNT@NPC precursor and melamine.\nFurthermore, in order to further demonstrate the advantages of the designed CNT@NPC catalysts with nanoporous sheath and conductive CNT cores, two more control catalysts were prepared in parallel at the same conditions as that for CNT@NPC-900. One is pure N-doped CNTs without nanoporous sheath, whereas the other is N-doped carbon from glucose polymerization and N-doping with no addition of CNTs. Fig. 4e shows the comparison of ORR electrocatalytic performances of these two catalysts and CNT@NPC-900. It can be clearly seen that the designed CNT@NPC-900 catalysts exhibited much enhanced electrocatalytic activity for ORR in terms of impressively positive shift of onset potential and half-wave potential.\nMoreover, fuel crossover is an important issue in fuel cells.19 A good ORR catalyst should exhibit satisfactory tolerance to fuel, for example, methanol in direct methanol fuel cells. Therefore, we measured the polarization curves of both CNT@NPC-900 and Pt/C catalysts in the presence or absence of 0.5 M methanol for testing possible poisoning effects. As seen in Fig. 5a, a severe negative shift was found for LSV curve of Pt/C catalyst recorded in the presence of 0.5 M methanol. The drastic negative shift of E1/2 of 214 mV indicated the dramatic decrease of ORR activity in the presence of methanol. In contrast, almost no loss in E1/2 was observed in case of CNT@NPC-900 (Fig. 5b), revealing that it exhibited excellent tolerance to methanol poisoning effects. Finally, the durability of the catalysts was verified by chronoamperometric technique. It can be seen in Fig. 5c that the commercial Pt/C suffered from a 40% decrease in current density after tests for 20000 s while CNT@NPC-900 showed only about 30% loss, suggesting CNT@NPC-900 had better durability.', '4.
