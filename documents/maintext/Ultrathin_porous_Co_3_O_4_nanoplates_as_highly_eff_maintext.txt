{'Abstract': 'Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are of central importance for electrocatalytic/photocatalytic water oxidation and fuel generation. Here we report a new type of ultrathin porous Co3O4 nanoplate as a highly efficient OER catalyst. The porous Co3O4 nanoplates annealed at 250 °C can be readily synthesized in large quantities with a large surface area of 160.9 m2 g−1, a very small crystalline size of ∼3.0 nm, and a thin thickness of ∼10 nm. The large surface area provides more surface active sites for the OER. The structural features of the porous nanoplates significantly enrich the amount of surface abundant catalytic sites, provide more active edge and corner cobalt species with low coordination numbers, and subsequently enhance their OER activity. Meanwhile, the thin thickness facilitates efficient diffusion of chemicals and the escape of the generated O2 within the electrode. Taken all together, the porous Co3O4 nanoplates annealed at 250 °C deliver a high OER activity with an overpotential as low as 258 mV at 1 mA cm−2, a turnover frequency of 0.0042 s−1 (low bound), a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec−1 in 1.0 M KOH solution and an excellent electrochemical stability.', 'Introduction': 'Inspired by a recent report of Co–Pi electrocatalysts with a high OER activity, much attention has been devoted to cobalt based materials for water oxidation.20In situ X-ray absorption studies indicated that the high OER activities of Co–Pi catalysts could be attributed to the existence of Co4O4 cubane in the catalysts.31 Co3O4 has a typical spinel structure, in which Co2+ is located at tetrahedral sites and Co3+ occupies octahedral sites. The Co4O4 cubane made of octahedral cobalt and oxygen atoms indicates that Co3O4 has the potential for use as an OER catalyst.32,33 Previous studies have verified that the OER activities of Co3O4 nanostructures are strongly correlated with their available surface areas.16 Hence, various strategies have been designed to synthesize Co3O4 catalysts with large surface area and small crystalline size. However, the charge transfer of small Co3O4 nanoparticles with a large surface area is insufficient due to the existence of a large number of grain boundaries.16,34 One approach to solve the charge transfer problem of small nanoparticles is to synthesize porous Co3O4 nanostructures, which preserve the large surface area and small crystalline size features and reduce the amount of grain boundaries.16,34 Another strategy is to maintain the small size of Co3O4 and enhance the charge transfer by dispersing small Co3O4 nanostructures on various conductive supports, e.g. Au,34 Ni foam,16 multi-wall carbon nanotubes26,35 and graphene.36 Their electrochemical activities clearly demonstrate the potential of Co3O4 and their hybrids for use as efficient and robust OER catalysts. However, most methods reported to date involve time-consuming or complex synthetic procedures. For example, the synthesis of ordered mesoporous Co3O4 by a typical hard template method requires multiple steps including: synthesis of a template, grafting of cobalt sources, formation of cobalt oxides and removal of the template.\nHerein, we report a facile method combining wet chemistry and high temperature annealing for the scalable synthesis of porous Co3O4 nanoplates. We show that the surface area, pore size, pore density and crystalline size of the resulting porous nanoplates can be easily tailored by varying the annealing temperature. The small crystalline size of Co3O4 is found to be critical to improving the catalytic activity of the catalysts in terms of turnover frequency by delivering abundant surface active sites with low coordination numbers. The contiguous framework of ultrathin (∼10 nm) porous nanoplates not only ensures efficient charge transfer by reducing the number of grain boundaries but also allows easy escape of generated O2 and rapid recovery of surface catalytic sites. Moreover, our study clearly demonstrates that the higher catalytic activity of the surface active centers originates from their small crystalline size, which was ignored in the previous studies of Co-based OER catalysts. The porous Co3O4 nanoplates annealed at 250 °C exhibit the largest surface area (160.9 m2 g−1) and the smallest crystalline size (∼3 nm), which deliver a high catalytic activity for water oxidation reactions.', 'Experimental': 'Synthesis of β-Co(OH)2 and porous Co3O4 nanoplates\nPreparation of ordered mesoporous Co3O4 nanostructures using KIT-6 as hard templates\nOrdered mesoporous Co3O4 nanostructures were prepared by using KIT-6 as the hard template. In brief, 0.2 g of KIT-6 was dispersed in 5 mL of 0.8 M Co(NO3)2·6H2O in ethanol. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and dried at 60 °C. The obtained powder was calcined at 350 °C for 4 h at a ramp rate of 1 °C min−1. Finally, the silica template was removed by dispersing 50 mg of the products in 10 mL of 2 M NaOH solution for 6 hours. The etched samples were centrifuged, washed thoroughly with water, and dried at 60 °C overnight.\nCharacterization\nElectrochemical measurements', 'Results and discussion': 'Characterization of β-Co(OH)2 nanoplates\nThe thermal behavior of β-Co(OH)2 nanoplates was investigated by TGA (Fig. 1d). The initial weight loss of the nanoplates up to 120 °C can be ascribed to the desorption of physisorbed and/or trapped water molecules. With increasing the temperature, a sharp weight loss was observed at 210 °C. When the temperature was above 250 °C, the weight variation became negligible. The actual weight loss of the β-Co(OH)2 nanoplates derived from the TGA curve is 13.8%, which is very consistent with the theoretical value (13.6%) for converting Co(OH)2 into Co3O4.\nCharacterization of porous Co3O4 nanoplates\nTo investigate the electronic structure of the as-prepared surface, we measured the XPS spectrum of Co3O4-250. All the spectra were referenced to the aliphatic carbon at a binding energy (BE) of 284.5 eV. From Fig. S3a,† it can be seen clearly that Co(OH)2 and HFC-250 contain the elements of O 1s and Co 2p. The high-resolution Co2p spectrum (Fig. S3b†) shows spin–orbit splitting into 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 components. The peaks of Co 2p3/2 are at 781.1 eV and 780.7 eV for Co(OH)2 and Co3O4-250, respectively. The slight decrease in the binding energy of the annealed samples indicates the formation of Co3O4, which is consistent with previous reports.38,39\nMore importantly, the porous structures after annealing at various temperatures can be clearly seen from TEM images (Fig. 2a–d). The generation of pores confined within the nanoplates could be attributed to the slow dehydration, in which the loss of water molecules created the pores without disturbing the plate shape. The structural information of all products is summarized in Table 1. Co3O4-250 has the largest surface area of 160.9 m2 g−1, which is much larger than 68.3 m2 g−1 of β-Co(OH)2 nanoplates and comparable to mesoporous Co3O4 synthesized by the nanocasting method.34 The average pore size (3.7 nm) of Co3O4-250 derived from the BET measurement (Fig. S4†) is well consistent with ∼3.0 nm as observed in the TEM image (Fig. 2a and S5†). With increasing annealing temperature, the surface areas of the porous Co3O4 nanoplates decreased to 138.0, 106.9 and 87.6 m2 g−1 for Co3O4-300, Co3O4-400 and Co3O4-500, respectively. Meanwhile, by increasing the calcination temperature, the average number of pores for 100 × 100 nm2 was significantly reduced from 200 to 80, 40 and 25 for Co3O4-250, Co3O4-300, Co3O4-400 and Co3O4-500, respectively. And also the pore size became large due to the structural collapse under high temperature treatment. As shown in Table 1 and as evidenced in Fig. 2, large pores of over 10 nm were observed in Co3O4-500.\nElectrocatalytic water oxidation\nThe electrocatalytic activities of all catalysts in 0.1 M KOH including the overpotentials at the specified current densities of 5 or 10 or 20 mA cm−2, the current densities at 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the calculated turnover frequencies (TOFs) at 400 mV overpotential, are summarized in Table 1. The best activity was observed on the electrode loaded with Co3O4-250. As shown in Fig. 3a, the onset potential of Co3O4-250 is 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is 110, 125, 125 and 140 mV higher than those of the Co3O4-300, Co3O4-400, Co3O4-500 and Co(OH)2 electrodes, respectively. At a current density of 5 mA cm−2, the overpotential for Co3O4-250 is 472 mV while the overpotentials for Co3O4-300, Co3O4-400 and Co3O4-500 are 509, 535 and 539 mV, respectively. A similar trend was also observed at the current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm−2. The current density of 47.9 mA cm−2 for the Co3O4-250 electrode at 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was much higher than those of 34.5, 33.4 and 26.4 mA cm−2 for the Co3O4-300, Co3O4-400 and Co3O4-500 electrodes, respectively.\nThe electrocatalytic OER activity of β-Co(OH)2 nanoplates was also measured. The overpotentials at current densities of 5 and 10 mA cm−2 were respectively 587 and 665 mV, much higher than those of porous Co3O4 nanoplates (Table 1). The current density at 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was 15.1 mA cm−2, which was 31.5% and 57.2% of the current densities of the Co3O4-250 and Co3O4-500 electrodes, respectively. The results suggest that the porous Co3O4 nanoplates deliver much better OER activity than that of the Co(OH)2 nanoplates.\nIt is difficult to directly compare the electrocatalytic activities of the porous Co3O4 nanoplates with previously reported Co3O4 catalysts since many factors affect the OER, such as material synthesis methods, catalyst loading, supports, the pH value of electrolyte solution, etc.16 Herein, ordered mesoporous Co3O4, named Co3O4-meso, was prepared by using KIT-6 mesoporous silica as the hard template at 35 °C, which exhibited the largest surface area and the best OER activity in a previous report.34 The ordered mesoporous Co3O4 (Fig. S6†) has a surface area of 128.1 m2 g−1. The electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4-meso was also evaluated for comparison. The overpotentials at 5, 10, and 20 mA cm−2 current densities were respectively 596, 652 and 734 mV, which were much higher than that of the porous Co3O4 nanoplates at the corresponding current densities. The current density of 20.1 mA cm−2 at 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for Co3O4-meso was 6.3 mA cm−2 smaller than that of Co3O4-500 and only 42% of Co3O4-250. The commercially available 10 wt% Ir/C catalyst was also measured simultaneously. The onset potential of the Ir/C catalyst was similar to that of porous Co3O4 catalysts, but its OER current density fell far below that of porous Co3O4 nanoplates (Fig. 3a). The current density at 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was 13.6 mA cm−2, only 28.4% of that of Co3O4-250. These results demonstrate that our approach can achieve highly active porous Co3O4 catalysts for the OER.\nAssuming that the Faraday efficiency is 100% and every surface cobalt atom is an active site for the OER, the TOF for each catalyst can be calculated from the electrode current density at an overpotential of 400 mV. The calculated TOF for Co3O4-250 in 0.1 M KOH was 2.81 × 10−3 s−1, which was 3.80, 5.35 and 5.01 times higher than those for Co3O4-300, Co3O4-400 and Co3O4-500 (Fig. 3b), respectively. The highest TOF and the lowest overpotentials at a specific current density (Table 1) for Co3O4-250 unambiguously illustrate the importance of specific physicochemical properties of Co3O4 catalysts for the OER.\nAs summarized in Table 1, the surface area of Co3O4-250 (160.9 m2 g−1) is only 1.16–1.84 times larger than that of Co3O4 catalysts, while the TOF of Co3O4-250 is 3.80–5.35 times higher than that of Co3O4 catalysts. Hence, the surface area cannot explain the OER activities in this work. Ideally, the surface activity of cobalt-based active sites should be equal for all catalysts if they are in the same reactive environment, leading to the same values of TOFs for all Co3O4 catalysts. Such a high TOF for Co3O4-250 can be partly attributed to the high pore density and the small crystalline size of nanowalls of Co3O4-250, which both provide more corner and edge sites. It is well known that the catalytic active atoms at corner or edge sites of a catalyst with a lower coordination number always exhibit a higher catalytic activity. This phenomenon becomes significant for nanoscale catalysts, which was neglected in previous studies on the surface area effect of Co3O4 nanoparticles on the OER.16\nHerein, the crystalline size of Co3O4-250 (Fig. 2a) is around 3.0 nm, which is much smaller than those of other porous Co3O4 nanoplates (Fig. 2) and the size of Co3O4-meso is around 6.5 nm (Fig. S6†). The amount of the corner and edge cobalt atoms of Co3O4-250 is much larger than those of other Co3O4 catalysts. Therefore, a higher activity of Co3O4-250 for water oxidation was expected and indeed observed.\nAlthough the surface areas of Co3O4-400 and Co3O4-500 are smaller than that of Co3O4-meso and their crystalline sizes are larger than that of Co3O4-meso, the calculated TOFs are still nearly 1.5 times higher than that of Co3O4-meso. This result might be explained by the diffusion of the electrolyte and the transport of the generated O2. O2 regeneration on each active site could only occur after the escape of the produced O2. The channel length of the Co3O4-meso catalysts is usually over hundreds of nanometers, with a much longer pathway for the escape of the generated O2 and the diffusion of the electrolyte. In contrast, porous Co3O4 nanoplates with 10 nm thickness may provide a much shorter channel length. The diffusion of the electrolyte or the generated oxygen can be evaluated using Nyquist plots obtained from EIS (Fig. 3c). In the low frequency ranges of the Nyquist plots, the straight line corresponds to the Warburg resistance relative to the diffusion of the electrolyte within the electroactive materials. Generally, a higher slope indicates more efficient diffusion of the electrolyte.41,42 The slopes of the Nyquist plots are 82.8°, 77.5° and 74.5° for Co3O4-250, Co3O4-400 and Co3O4-500 electrodes, which are much larger than that of Co3O4-meso (69.0°). Therefore, the much more efficient diffusion of the electrolyte within porous Co3O4 nanoplate electrodes can help the escape of the generated O2 and hence improve the OER activity of the porous Co3O4 nanoplates.\nThe iR-correction (Fig. S7†) was also performed to further evaluate the activities of the catalysts. Fig. S7† shows the 95% iR-corrected polarization curves of the Co3O4-250, Co3O4-meso and Ir/C catalysts on ITO electrodes in 0.1 M KOH. The measured current density of the Co3O4-250 electrode at 1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) was 140.0 mA cm−2, which was 4.67 and 8.92 times higher than those for the Co3O4-meso and Ir/C electrodes, respectively. On the thermodynamic side, the overpotentials for the Co3O4-250, Co3O4-meso and Ir/C catalysts at 10 mA cm−2 current density were 490, 634, and 700 mV, respectively. The results also confirm that Co3O4-250 with the largest surface area, the smallest crystalline size and the shortest pore length has the best activity for water oxidation, compared to ordered mesoporous Co3O4 and commercially available Ir/C catalysts.\nPhotocatalytic water oxidation\nEffect of the electrolyte basicity on the catalytic activity of Co3O4\nFig. 4c presents the electrocatalytic activities (with iR correction) of Co3O4-250, Co3O4-meso and commercially available Ir/C catalysts in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. Similar to the results of the electrochemical performance of three catalysts in 0.1 M KOH, Co3O4-250 catalysts displayed the best activity, in terms of the highest current densities at the specific applied bias and the lowest overpotentials at the specific current densities. We also fitted the polarization curves of Co3O4-250 and Co3O4-meso shown in Fig. 4c to the Tafel equation. As presented in Fig. 4d, the derived Tafel slopes for Co3O4-250 and Co3O4-meso are 71 and 98 mV dec−1, respectively. Considering the difference in their crystalline sizes, the lower value of the Tafel slope for Co3O4-250 may be attributed to the smaller crystalline size by providing abundant surface active sites with low coordination numbers, compared to that of Co3O4-meso. The value of the Tafel slope of Co3O4-250 is close to that reported for the reduced porous Co3O4 nanowires (72 mV dec−1),43 Co3O4 nanoparticles (78 mV dec−1) and Co3O4/graphene composites (68 mV dec−1),36 suggesting a high OER activity of the porous Co3O4 nanoplates.\nCatalytic stability of Co3O4-250', 'Conclusions': '', 'Acknowledgements': 'M.
