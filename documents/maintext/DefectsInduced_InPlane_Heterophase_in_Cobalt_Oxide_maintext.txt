With the increasingly serious energy and environment issues, developing green and renewable energy to replace traditional fossil energy has attracted researchers' attention. Electrochemical energy devices, such as fuel cell,1 metal–air battery,2 and water splitting devices3 are regarded as the most promising candidates because of their high theoretical energy density, high transfer efficiency, and low pollution. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important component in many electrochemical devices.4 However, its kinetic rate is sluggish and usually needs large overpotential to proceed, which seriously impedes the commercial application of these electrochemical energy devices. At present, noble metal catalysts, such as RuO2 and IrO2, are generally regarded as the best electrocatalysts for OER. However, high cost, limited resources, and poor stability make them hard to satisfy the requirement of commercial demands. Thus, it's of extreme urgency to develop effective, cheap, and stable OER electrocatalysts.
Spinels, which are briefly described as AB2O4 (where metal ions A2+ bond with O anions to form tetrahedrons and metal ions B3+ bond with O anions to form octahedrons),5 have attracted much attention as OER electrocatalysts because of low cost, rich resources and good stability in alkaline solution. However, the electrochemical activities of spinels are restricted by the limited number of reactive sites, little electrical conductivity, and poor intrinsic activity. Therefore, numerous strategies have been applied to improve electrochemical OER activities of metal oxide such as combining with conductive supports,6 doping with other elements,7 controlling facet phase,8 incorporating vacancies,9 and designing nanostructures.10 In these strategies, constructing heterophase interface, which can inherit both functions of two different phases and accelerate electron transfer at interface with rapid reaction progress, is an extremely effective method to enhance the activity of electrocatalysts.11, 12 For example, Liu and co-workers have synthesized Pd@PdO2@Co3O4 nanocubes to exhibit excellent OER activity due to the synergistic effects of Pd, PdO2, and Co3O4, including increased electronic conductivity, more exposed active sites, and less extra energy barrier to drive electrochemical reaction.13 Guo et al. designed Co3O4/Fe0.33Co0.66P interface nanowire by partial etching and phosphorization treatment with an effective charge separation of agglomerated electron–hole region at interface and decreasing oxygen evolution free energy barrier to show splendid OER activity.14 Recently, defects play an important role in modifying electrocatalysts for diverse electrochemical reaction.15 Incorporating proper content of oxygen vacancies was regarded as an efficient way to improve the electrochemical capacity of metal oxides.16, 17 It was also reported by Terashima et al. that oxygen vacancies can induce the formation of anatase/brookite TiO2 heterophase.18 Introducing defects was also believed as an important method to construct heterophase interface.
Combined with above advantages of heterophase interface, herein, we elaborately constructed subtle structural distinction Co3O4/CoO spinel/rocksalt heterophase interface in Co3O4 nanosheets by incorporation of vast oxygen vacancies. First, pristine Co3O4 spinel nanosheets were synthesized by annealing Co(OH)2 that eletrodeposited on Ti foil. Subsequently, the obtained pristine Co3O4 nanosheets were suffered from Ar-plasma etching for different time (60, 120, and 180 s) to explore structure evolution and induce the formation of Co3O4/CoO spinel/rocksalt heterophase interface, marked as Co3O4/CoO-60 s, Co3O4/CoO-120 s, and Co3O4/CoO-180 s, respectively. The in situ formed CoO rocksalt structure may be caused by the diffusion of Co2+ ions at tetrahedrons 8a sites with the presence of oxygen vacancies to neighboring octahedrons 16c sites, while the octahedrons 16d sites will be kept with a little volume change (Scheme 1). With the successful construction of Co3O4/CoO heterophase interface, the OER activity was improved drastically, for which the overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 was only 302 mV and reaction kinetic rate was fastened. Periodic density functional theory (DFT) computations reveal that the enhanced OER properties can be attributed to lower-lying p states energy of adsorbed-O for Co3O4/CoO heterophase than that for Co3O4, leading to dramatically decrease of reaction energy barrier.

The morphology of all samples was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It can be seen from Figure S1 (Supporting Information) that all samples still keep the pristine nanosheet morphology after Ar-plasma treatment, which is dense and continuous. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to determine the crystal structure of samples. Apart from the diffraction peaks of pure Ti foil, peaks at 18.9°, 31.5°, 36.9°, 44.8°, and 65.5° can be indexed to the (111), (220), (311), (400), and (440) planes of spinel Co3O4, respectively. After different plasma treatment time, the spinel structure is still kept as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Co3O4 nanosheets have been successfully synthesized and bulk Co3O4 phase was kept after plasma treatment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and spherical-aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were carried on to get a deep understanding about crystalline structure and explore the subtle structure evolution at high spatial resolution. As displayed in Figure 1A–D, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) images of Co3O4, Co3O4/CoO-60 s, Co3O4/CoO-120 s, and Co3O4/CoO-180 s all can be indicated to Co3O4 phase. The corresponding low-magnification TEM images (Figure S3, Supporting Information) all exhibit nanosheet morphology, which is consistent with XRD and SEM results. HRTEM image of Co3O4 is shown in Figure 1E and the inset image is its fast Fourier transform (FFT) which corresponds to spinel structure along [111] zone axis. What's more, the formation of CoO rocksalt phase can be clearly observed from the HRTEM image of Co3O4/CoO-60 s. As indicated in Figure 1F, the HRTEM image shows not only the presence of Co3O4 spinel structure along [111] zone axis (red image) but also the CoO rocksalt structure along [111] zone axis (green image). Co3O4/CoO heterophase interface could be successfully in situ constructed after plasma-etching. With increasing plasma treatment time to 120 s, more heterophase interfaces could be introduced (Figure 1G). However, less heterophase interfaces exist after further increasing plasma treatment time to 180 s, which may be removed by overtreatment with Ar-plasma etching (Figure 1H). The enlarged image of white boxed region for Co3O4/CoO is shown in Figure 1I and we can clearly see the existence of Co3O4/CoO heterophase interface. The lattice fringes of 0.29 and 0.15 nm are corresponding to (022) plane of Co3O4 and CoO, respectively. STEM image (Figure 1J, and Figure S4, Supporting Information) can also prove the appearance of Co3O4/CoO spinel/rocksalt heterophase interface. As it is well known that there are two different coordination configurations for cobalt cations in a perfect Co3O4 spinel structure. One is Co3+ cations occupying the octahedral sites and the other is Co2+ cations occupying the tetrahedral sites.19 Due to the different Co cations occupation, the TEM and STEM image contrast is uneven (dim in the center of diamond) for Co3O4. Co cations in CoO rocksalt structure all occupy the octahedral sites, which results in even TEM and STEM image contrast.20 As displayed by their atomic model structure in Figure 1K,L, the spacing of a unit cell of spinel structure projected along [111] zone axis (6.754 Å) is close to that of rocksalt structure projected along [111] zone axis (6.952 Å). The good lattice match can effectively reduce the internal strain and minimize the Co3O4/CoO heterophase interfacial strain.21 Above all, subtle CoO rocksalt phase has been successfully in situ produced in an integrated Co3O4 spinel phase. Fan et al. have demonstrated that the interface charge transfer could be facilitated in the epitaxial-grown interface of Co and Ni3N leading to gorgeous electrochemical activity.12 Thus, it can be expected that the construction of Co3O4/CoO heterophase interface can combine structural characteristics of both CoO and Co3O4 and facilitate electron transfer at interface with a rapid adsorption to OER intermediates to show excellent OER activity.

Raman spectroscopy was used to explore the structure of Co3O4 samples. All the peaks can be indicated to the typical structure of Co3O4 (Figure 2A). The Raman band at 183.5 cm−1 can be corresponded to F12g symmetry of tetrahedral sites (CoO4), which can be attributed to Raman vibration of Co2+-O2−. The band at 665.0 cm−1 can be ascribed to A1g species of octahedral sites (CoO6), which is corresponding to Co3+-O2− Raman vibration. After plasma treatment, both F12g (Figure 2B) and A1g (Figure 2C) bonds exhibit blueshift compared with Co3O4, which can be attributed to existence of oxygen vacancies.22 The optical adsorption property of Co3O4 samples was explored by UV–vis spectra as shown in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). The adsorption peaks located at about 380 and 690 nm−1 can be attributed to charge transfer between ligand to metal O2−-Co2+ and O2−-Co3+, respectively.23 It is obvious that the intensity of O2−-Co2+ is much stronger than that of O2−-Co3+ with the increasing of plasma treatment time, indicating more Co2+ ion is produced after plasma treatment. This may be due to the reducing ability of Ar-plasma. The change of electronic environment in all samples was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra. As shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), the Co 2p spectra can be divided into eight sublevels. The energy bandgap between Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 peaks is 15.0 eV. The binding energies at 779.8 and 781.1 eV with two satellite peaks at 784.23 and 789.07 eV are assigned to Co 2p3/2 of Co3O4. Co 2p1/2 can also be divided into four peaks at 794.7 and 796.1 eV with two satellite peaks at 799.2 and 804.1 eV, respectively. While the binding energy at 779.8 and 781.1 eV can indicate coexist of Co3+ and Co2+.24 The Co2+/Co3+ atom ratios of all Co3O4 samples are summarized and we can clearly see the increased content of Co2+ as shown in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Figure S7 (Supporting Information) shows the Co K edge XANES spectra of Co3O4 and Co3O4/CoO-120 s. Both of them exhibit similar spectroscopy plot and the inset image in Figure S7 (Supporting Information) shows the adsorption edge slightly shifts to low energy at range from 7718 to 7724 eV indicating decrease of valence state of cobalt cations.25 The Fourier transformed (FT) k3χ(k)-R space curves for plasma-etched Co3O4 samples (Figure 2D) show that the first peak at ≈1.5 Å is assigned to Co-O coordination shells. It is difficult to distinguish Co3+-O shell and Co2+-O shell due to the close proximity. After plasma-etching for 30 s (Co3O4/CoO-30 s), the oscillation amplitude of Co-O shells is less than that of pristine Co3O4, which reveals decreased coordination number due to the production of oxygen vacancies (Figure S8A,B, Supporting Information).26 The SAED and HRTEM images of Co3O4/CoO-30 s (Figure S9, Supporting Information) indicate the Co3O4 spinel phase is kept. The inset image in Figure 2D is the enlarged Co K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra on Co−O inter-atomic distance of Co3O4, Co3O4/CoO-60 s, Co3O4/CoO-120 s, and Co3O4/CoO-180 s. The right-shift of peak can be attributed to reduction of cobalt cations at catalyst surface27, 28 and the reincreased oscillation amplitude can be assigned to the introduction of CoO rocksalt phase due to the different Co-O coordination environment in Co3O4 and CoO (Figure S10, Supporting Information). So, with the successful construction of Co3O4/CoO interface, the coordination number of Co-O will increase at initial and then decrease with the further introduction of oxygen vacancies and reincrease with the newly formed CoO structure. The second peaks at 2.45 Å can be attributed to the distance of two octahedral Co sites as shown in Figure S8C (Supporting Information) and the increased oscillation amplitude can be due to the incorporation of CoO rocksalt phase.29

E) Different crystallographic sites in Co3O4 structure. F) The model of Co3O4 primitive cell without and with one oxygen vacancy (Co3O4/CoO), respectively, where two Co atoms in tetrahedral configuration (8a) diffuse to the sites with octahedral coordination (16c). G) The energy barrier required for every Co atom to diffuse from 8(a) to 16(c) site of Co3O4 (without oxygen vacancy) and Co3O4/CoO (with oxygen vacancy), respectively.
In order to explore the formation mechanism of the heterophase interface, DFT calculation was performed. Co2+ ions occupy tetrahedral 8a sites and Co3+ ions occupy octahedral 16d sites in an ideal normal spinel structure. Octahedral 16c interstitial sites share two faces with 8a and six faces with tetrahedral 48f interstitial sites (Figure 2E).19 With external driving force, the Co2+ ions at 8a sites can diffuse into neighboring 16c sites as interstitial atom through face-sharing polyhedron to form rocksalt structure, while octahedral frame of 16d sites will suffer a little volume change. For DFT calculation, a bulk structure model of Co3O4 primitive cell was chosen. Co3O4/CoO with one O-vacancy configuration was considered as a comparison as shown in Figure 2F. For the perfect structure, the energy barrier for Co atom diffusion from 8a to 16c site was calculated to be 0.67 eV atom−1 indicating an unfavorable migration in lattice. In contrast, introducing one oxygen vacancy can substantially decrease the diffusion barrier to 0.39 eV atom−1 (Figure 2G), implying that the phase transfer can occur more easily in the presence of oxygen vacancy. Note that abundant oxygen vacancies generated by plasma etching was indeed detected experimentally, which explains the reason for preferentially generating the heterophase between Co3O4 and CoO. In sum, more Co2+ cations were produced and the electronic environment was rearrangement. It has been previously reported by Shao-Horn et al. that when the eg orbital occupancy of 3d transition-metal is close to unity, the electrochemical ability can be much higher due to the strong covalence of metal–oxygen bonds.30 The electronic configurations of Co2+ (t2g6eg1) and Co3+ (t2g6eg0) indicate the introduction of Co2+ can exhibit a better electronic configuration to show outstanding electrochemical activity. Moreover, the unique Co3O4/CoO heterophase structure can provide rich active sites and promote electron transfer at heterophase interface.
To evaluate the electrochemical activity, OER test was performed in 1.0 m KOH. From Figure 3A, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves clearly show that Co3O4/CoO-120 s exhibits significantly enhanced OER activity compared with that of Co3O4. The overpotential is only 302 mV, which is much lower than that of Co3O4 (394 mV), Co3O4/CoO-60 s (327 mV), and Co3O4/CoO-180 s (328 mV) (blue column in Figure S11A, Supporting Information). Meanwhile, at overpotential of 350 mV, Co3O4/CoO displays the largest current density of 42.16 mA cm−2, which is about eight times larger than that of Co3O4 and higher than that of Co3O4/CoO-60 s and Co3O4/CoO-180 s (red column in Figure S11A, Supporting Information). To evaluate OER kinetic, electrochemical parameter Tafel slope was achieved. As shown in Figure 3B, Compared with Co3O4 (149.6 mV dec−1), Co3O4/CoO-120 s exhibits smaller Tafel slope (68.6 mV dec−1), which is also smaller than that of Co3O4/CoO-60 s (88.1 mV dec−1) and Co3O4/CoO-180 s (102.8 mV dec−1) (Figure S11B, Supporting Information), which indicates faster reaction kinetic process. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were also performed to get a deep understanding about reaction kinetics between 0.01 Hz and 100 KHz. The equivalent circuit in Figure S12 (Supporting Information) is used to model Nyquist plots, where RΩ represents solution resistance, Cfilm and Rfilm are represented as the dielectric property and resistance of catalyst film, respectively. Cdl is related to double layered capacitance and CΦ models the relaxation of the charge associated with the adsorbed intermediate. Rs and Rp are related with the kinetics of the interfacial charge transfer reaction.31 As displayed in Figure 3C, the Nyquist plots of Co3O4 display two parts. The first semicircle is attributed to Rfilm at middle frequency and the straight line or the second semicircle is related with the resistance of charge transfer (Rct) at low frequency. Between 1.15 and 1.45 V, Rfilm is decreased with the increase of applied external potential. The nearly straight line indicates infinite Rct and OER is difficult to occur without enough overpotential to drive. At high potential of 1.55 or 1.65 V, the Nyquist plot displays two semicircles as shown in inset of Figure 3C. Figure S13 and Table S2 (Supporting Information) display the summary of values fitted for various elements. The two peaks in Bode phase plots (Figure 3E) gradually move closely with the increase of potential. For Co3O4/CoO-120 s, the Nyquist plots show nearly line plots in the range of 1.15–1.45 V indicating infinite Rct. Moreover, Rfilm nearly disappears and exhibits small values indicating significantly improved electronic conductivity. When the applied potential is higher than 1.55 V, a semicircle appears in Nyquist plot (inset of Figure 3D) and the peak in corresponding Bode phase moves to higher frequency (Figure 3F). The specific values of various elements for Co3O4/CoO-120 s are provided in Figure S14 and Table S3 (Supporting Information). Figure 3G shows the phase angle relaxation curves selected from Co3O4 (1.65 V) and Co3O4/CoO-120 s (1.55 V) based on similar current density (Figure 3A). Compared with that of Co3O4, the phase angle curve of Co3O4/CoO-120 s only displays the surface oxidation behavior which is dominated with Co2+.23 In order to evaluate the efficiency of electron during OER process, we performed rotating ring-disk electrode test at the ring potential of was 0.37 V and the disk current was kept at 200 µA. As shown in Figure S15 (Supporting Information), the ring current of Co3O4 is about 32.3 µA, while the ring current of Co3O4/CoO-120 s is about 40.1 µA, corresponding to the Faradic efficiency of 76.9% and 95.5%, respectively. This illustrates higher electron efficiency of Co3O4/CoO-120 s than that of Co3O4, which is consistent with in situ EIS results. Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots were measured to determine the content of charge carriers as shown in Figure S16 (Supporting Information) at frequency of 1000 Hz. The negative values of slope of M–S plots indicate the p-typed semiconductor of Co3O4. The smaller absolute value of slope of M–S plots for Co3O4/CoO-120 s than that of Co3O4 indicates more charge carrier in Co3O4/CoO-120 s and more defects existed.20 Figure S17 (Supporting Information) shows the cyclic voltammetry curves of Co3O4 and Co3O4/CoO-120 s. A pair of redox peak at 1.40 and 1.45 V can be attributed to the redox of Co3+/Co4+ in Co3O4. After plasma treatment, a peak at 1.12 V appears in Co3O4/CoO-120 s, which is assigned to the oxidation of Co2+/Co3+ and cannot be reduced reversibly.32 The redox characterization peak of Co3+/Co4+ becomes less obvious indicating the decrease of Co3+ content. It has been reported that Co3+ ions are responsible for surface double-layer capacitance activity behavior with strong OH− adsorption and Co2+ ions are contributed to OER current.25 It may be concluded that the adsorption behavior of OER intermediate on Co3O4/CoO-120 s has been modulated by the heterophase. Stability is also an important index to evaluate electrochemical activity. Co3O4/CoO-120 s exhibits good durability after 40 000 s test under current density of 10 mA cm−2 as shown in Figure S18 (Supporting Information).

DFT computations were then employed to investigate the origin of the improved performance for OER. According to experimental characterization by HRTEM, we built three models in this work: Co3O4 (110), CoO (110) surface, and heterophase formed between them (Figure 4A). Previous investigations have shown that thermodynamics analysis can describe the trend of OER on metal oxide surface reasonably.33 By using computational hydrogen electrode model,31 we calculated the free energy diagram of OER on the surfaces above. Then, we can obtain the limiting potential (UL), at which all element steps become exergonic, as a first-order indication of potential-dependent activity.34 There are two types of Co atoms on Co3O4 (110) surface and Co3O4/CoO, namely three-(3f) and fourfold (4f) coordinated Co atoms. Consistent with previous calculations,35 the Co3f sites on Co3O4 (110) surface will dominate the activity of OER since Co4f bridge site binds oxygen too strongly, which suffers from a rather high overpotential. As shown in Figure 4B, the most positive energy change (1.73 eV) for Co3O4 is found for the second step, i.e., removing the proton from OH*. Thus each reaction steps of OER become exothermic at potentials above 1.73 V, which can convert to a theoretical overpotential of 0.5 V. Compared to Co3O4 (110) facet, the heterophase in Co3O4/CoO tends to lower the value of the energy change of the second step (∆EO–∆EOH) (Figure 4B). This result in the third step, namely, splitting the second water molecule, becomes potential-determined step with an energy change of 1.65 eV. This means that the theoretical overpotential for Co3O4/CoO is lower than pristine Co3O4 by 0.08 V, which is in good agreement with experimental observations. The decrease of ∆EO–∆EOH can be attributed to the changes of the electronic structure of adsorbed oxygen intermediate in OER. The calculated p-states projected onto oxygen intermediate show that the average p-state energy of adsorbed oxygen intermediate for Co3O4/CoO is 0.2 eV lower-lying than pristine Co3O4 (110) surface (Figure 4C). Based on well-documented average p-band theory,36 lower-lying p states correspond to a smaller ∆EO–∆EOH, which are the results we have observed.

XPS and TEM characterizations were also carried out to analyze the electron and structure properties of Co3O4/CoO-120 s after first OER test and stability test. As shown in Figure S19A,B (Supporting Information), the peaks of cobalt all shift to lower binding energy after first LSV test and stability test, which can be indicated to the increase of cobalt valence state. This phenomenon may be caused by strong oxidation condition during OER process.4 As shown in Figures S20 and S21A,B (Supporting Information), after first LSV test and stability test, the samples keep nanosheet morphology and Co3O4 spinel phase. CoO2 phase along [110] zone axis (purple image) and CoOOH phase along [101] zone axis (yellow image) can be found after first LSV test (Figure S21C, Supporting Information). The formation of CoOOH phase along [001] zone axis (yellow image) could also be observed after stability test for 40 000 s under current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Figure S21D, Supporting Information). This phenomenon is consistent with the generally recognized OER pathway of transition metal oxide in alkaline solution, as described in Figure S21E (Supporting Information). The formation of CoOOH is hypothesized to be the rating-determining step.26, 37 According to previous report, CoO is much easier to be oxidized into CoOOH than Co3O4, which is regarded as real active sites to facilitate OER process. The construction of Co3O4/CoO heterophase interface could not only effectively accelerate charge transfer rate at interface and improve reaction kinetic rate but also optimize reaction adsorption energy to form active species to facilitate electrochemical reaction.
In summary, Co3O4/CoO spinel/rocksalt heterophase interface has been successfully in situ constructed in Co3O4 nanosheets by incorporation of oxygen vacancies. The heterophase interface could be clearly visualized by HRTEM and STEM. The change of coordination environment has been carefully investigated by EXAFS. With the introduction of Co3O4/CoO heterophase interface, the Co3O4/CoO exhibits more outstanding electrochemical activity and faster kinetic rate than pristine Co3O4. The overpotential to reach 10 mA cm−2 is declined as much as 92 mV. Periodic DFT computations reveal that, with the existence of oxygen vacancies, the energy barrier for diffusion of Co atom from 8a to 16c site is significantly decreased, implying more favorable formation of Co3O4/CoO heterophase. The lower-lying average p-state energy of adsorbed-O for Co3O4/CoO heterophase than that for Co3O4 can dramatically decrease the adsorption energy leading to an outstanding OER performance. This work develops a new method to construct heterophase interface in electrocatalysts and deeply demonstrates the relationship between heterophase interface and OER activity.
Experimental Section
The electrodeposited Co(OH)2 was obtained in a potentiostatic method at −1.0 V (vs Statured calomel electrode, SCE) for 10 min at 28 °C. Two Ti foils (2 × 4 cm) were used as working electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The reference electrode was SCE and electrolyte was 0.05 m Co(NO3)2·6H2O aqueous solution. The obtained sample was washed with deionized water and alcohol and dried at 60 °C. Co3O4 nanosheets were synthesized by annealing eletrodeposited Co(OH)2 at 250 °C for 3 h at 2 °C min−1. The obtained Co3O4 nanosheets were put into a plasma reactor and treated with Ar-plasma at 250 W for 30, 60, 120, and 180 s in the pressure of 50 Pa to construct the heterophase. The Ar-plasma etched Co3O4 for 120 s was used for detailed analysis.
