The development of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant nonprecious materials to replace the scarce platinum-group-metal-based ones is critically important for sustainable large-scale commercial applications of fuel cells and metal–air batteries.[1] The extensive research efforts over the recent years have led to a variety of nonprecious ORR electrocatalysts.[2] Among them, the nitrogen-coordinated transition-metal (TM) single-atoms (SAs) supported on carbon substrates have emerged as a new class of ORR electrocatalysts with enormous potentials.[3-5] These SA electrocatalysts (SAECs) anchor TM-SAs to the carbon substrates via TM–nitrogen (TMNx) coordination bonds that also act as the ORR active sites. It has been commonly accepted that the ORR activity of such TMNx-coordinated SA sites can be promoted by optimizing the binding strengths of ORR intermediates (e.g., *O2, *OOH, *OH, *O) to the active site via the altering of their electronic structures.[6] Various approaches have been reported to alter the electronic structures of TMNx-coordinated SA sites by modulating N types and coordinating numbers,[7] partially replacing N with other nonmetal elements (e.g., O, S, and P),[8] or the chemical compositions of carbon substrates.[9] Recently, the hetero-SAs (h-SAs) involving two different TMs (e.g., Co/Zn, Fe/Co, Fe/Zn) have been successfully anchored to the carbon substrates as ORR SAECs.[10] Such an approach takes the advantage of the coexistence of two different TM-SA sites, through the pairing and/or long-range coupling to alter each other's coordination environments, hence the electronic structures, to enhance ORR performance.[11, 12]
It is well-known that the performance of an electrocatalyst is determined not only by its intrinsic activity, but also the number of accessible active sites. The latter depends heavily on the dimension, geometry, and more profoundly, the pore structure of the electrocatalyst. Due to the high intrinsic activity nature of SAs and the relatively low solubility of O2 in aquatic media, a high performance ORR SAEC needs to be affixed on a carbon support with optimal pore structures.[13, 14] Ideally, a carbon substrate should possess a trimodal-porous structure: abundant micropores (<2 nm) to expose large numbers of TMNx-coordinated SA active sites, mesopores (2–50 nm) to facilitate local accessibility, and macropores (>50 nm) to promote long-range mass transfer.[13, 15] The mostly reported SAECs to date are nanoparticle (NP) forms with sizes between 10 and 100 nm that only possess micro- and mesopores, while the macropores can only be formed by the randomly packed NPs on the substrate electrode, resulting in the uncontrollable distribution and connectivity of mesopores and macropores.[16, 17] To this end, the controllably anchoring SAs to a microsized trimodal-porous carbon support with the mesopore-interconnected ordered macropores structure could be an effective solution to achieve rapid mass transfer to all accessible SA active sites, however, yet to be realized due to the challenges involved in the synthetic processes.
Herein, we report a h-SA ORR electrocatalyst with atomically dispersed Fe and Ni coanchored to a microsized trimodal-porous structured nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon support with highly ordered macropores (denoted as Fe/NiNx/OC). A template method is innovatively combined with wet-chemistry metal-ion impregnation and pyrolysis to simultaneously fabricate the uniquely configured trimodal-porous carbon support with highly ordered macropores interconnected by mesopores, and anchor Fe- and Ni-SAs via the FeN4 and NiN4 coordination bonds. The resultant Fe/NiNx/OC with Fe/Ni h-SAs possesses outstanding ORR activity, outperforming the SAECs with only Fe- or Ni-SAs, and the benchmark Pt/C. The obtained experimental results indicate that the outstanding ORR performance of Fe/NiNx/OC is resulted from the synergetic enhancement induced by the coexisting FeN4- and NiN4-coordinated SA sites, and the superior mass transfer promoted by the trimodal-porous structure of the carbon support.
Figure 1a schematically illustrates the synthetic procedure of Fe/NiNx/OC. In brief, the presynthesized polystyrene spheres (PSs, 270 nm in diameter) were first assembled into a 3D-ordered PS template (Figure S1a–c, Supporting Information).[18] The Fe3+ and Ni2+ were then impregnated via the formation of ZIF-8 (ZIF = zeolitic imidazolate framework) on the PS template in the presence of both Fe3+ and Ni2+ (denoted as (Fe, Ni)-ZiF-8@PS, Figure S1d (Supporting Information)). The obtained (Fe, Ni)-ZiF-8@PS was subjected to pyrolysis to decompose PSs and carbonize ZIF-8 (Figure S2, Supporting Information), while simultaneously anchor Fe and Ni to the formed carbon support, resulting in the uniformly sized and cuboctahedron-shaped Fe/NiNx/OC with an average size of 1.6 µm (Figure 1b and Figures S3a and S4a (Supporting Information)). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of Fe/NiNx/OC (Figure 1c–e, and Figures S3b and S4b (Supporting Information)) reveal a cuboctahedron-shaped structure with 3D-ordered macropores (≈180 nm) interconnected by 30–60 nm mesopores channels. Other than the mesopore channels, the abundant mesopores sized from 3 to 50 nm are presented on the carbon wall architectures (Figure S5, Supporting Information). The pore structure characteristics were further analyzed by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (Figure 1f,g) and summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information), which confirm the presence of micropores and reveal a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 800.9 m2 g−1 with an external surface area of 289.7 m2 g−1.[3, 13, 19] These results confirm the unique trimodal-porous structure of Fe/NiNx/OC. To further illustrate the formation of the hierarchical porous structure, Fe/NiNx/C with the average size of 85 nm and 1.4 µm, respectively, were fabricated without the assistance of PS template (Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information). The external surface area of Fe/NiNx/C (85 nm) and Fe/NiNx/C (1.4 µm) are found to be greatly reduced to 190 and 88.7 m2 g−1, corresponding to 24.6% and 16.4% of their total BET surface areas, respectively (Figure 1f and Table S1 (Supporting Information)). The pore size distribution analyses (Figure 1g) indicate the absence of meso-/macropores in Fe/NiNx/C (1.4 µm) and macropores in Fe/NiNx/C (85 nm), confirming the vital role of PS template to attain the trimodal-porous structures.

Other structural and compositional properties of Fe/NiNx/OC were obtained. The high-resolution TEM image, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, and Raman spectrum of Fe/NiNx/OC (Figures S5, S8, and S9, Supporting Information) confirm a highly graphitized carbon support.[4, 9] The XRD pattern indicates the absence of the crystalline forms of Fe and Ni nanoparticles. The N 1s spectrum of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure S10, Supporting Information) confirms the presence of N-doped graphitic carbons and metalNx coordination bonding.[20] Additionally, the N K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectrum (Figure S11, Supporting Information) reveals the existence of pyridine-like N (≈398.5 eV), graphitic N (≈401.5 eV), and metalNx bonding (≈399.8 eV), which are consistent with the XPS results.[20] The HAADF-STEM image (Figure 2a), the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Figure S12, Supporting Information), and elemental mapping (Figure S13, Supporting Information) demonstrate the presence of the atomically dispersed Fe and Ni species.[21] The Fe and Ni contents determined by the inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are 1.35 and 0.47 wt%, respectively, corresponding to a Fe:Ni mole ratio of 3.0 (Table S2, Supporting Information).

The synchrotron-based XANES and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were obtained to further confirm FeNx and NiNx coordination bonding configurations and their SA status. The Fe K-edge XANES spectra of Fe/NiNx/OC and the corresponding reference samples (Figure 2b) reveal that the absorption edge position of Fe in Fe/NiNx/OC closes to that of iron phthalocyanine (FePc), indicating a +2 valence state.[7, 22] The similar pre-edge profiles between Fe in Fe/NiNx/OC and FePc imply the formation of FeNx coordination.[22] Applying similar analysis to the Ni K-edge XANES spectra (Figure 2c) of Fe/NiNx/OC and the reference samples of Ni, NiO, and nickel phthalocyanine (NiPc) disclose the presence of +2 valence state Ni and NiNx coordination.[23] The Fe and Ni K-edge EXAFS spectra of Fe/NiNx/OC (Figure 2d,e) display a Fe peak centered at 1.48 Å, which closes to that of FePc (1.50 Å) and a Ni peak centered at 1.30 Å, which is almost identical to that of NiPc, further confirming the presence of FeNx- and NiNx-coordinated SA sites in Fe/NiNx/OC. Importantly, the absented peaks at 2.2 and 2.1 Å, respectively, from Fe and Ni K-edge EXAFS spectra of Fe/NiNx/OC confirm the absence of FeFe and NiNi metallic bonds, implying the atomically dispersed Fe and Ni SAs in Fe/NiNx/OC. Furthermore, the least-square EXAFS fitting was performed to depict structural parameters of Fe and Ni in the Fe/NiNx/OC (Figure S14 and Table S3, Supporting Information). Based on the above characterizations, as proposed in Figure 2f, it is reasonable to conclude that Fe and Ni atoms in Fe/NiNx/OC are dispersed separately in the forms of FeN4- and NiN4-coordinated SA sites.
In order to identify the ORR activity origin, the synthetic procedure shown in Figure 1a was also used to synthesize the N-doped carbons without both Fe and Ni (OC), and with only Fe-SAs (FeNx/OC) or Ni-SAs (NiNx/OC) (Figures S15–S17, Supporting Information) that possesses similar size, geometry, and trimodal-porous structures as that of Fe/NiNx/OC. The ICP-MS-determined Fe-SA content in FeNx/OC and Ni-SA content in NiNx/OC are 1.41 and 0.57 wt%, respectively.[4] For comparative purpose, the 400 and 220 nm PSs were used to synthesize Fe/NiNx/OCs with the average macropore sizes of 117 (denoted as Fe/NiNx/OC-117) and 281 nm (denoted as Fe/NiNx/OC-281) (Figures S18 and S19, Supporting Information). The BET surface areas of Fe/NiNx/OC-117 and Fe/NiNx/OC-281 are determined to be 796.4 and 993.5 m2 g−1, respectively (Table S1, Supporting Information).
The ORR performances of Fe/NiNx/OC, OC, NiNx/OC, FeNx/OC, and Pt/C (20 wt%) in both O2-saturated alkaline (0.1 m KOH) and acid (0.1 m HClO4) media were first evaluated. A rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) with the immobilized target electrocatalysts on its glassy-carbon disk was used as the working electrode. Figure 3a shows the voltammograms of different electrocatalysts in the O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH. Among them, Fe/NiNx/OC exhibits the best ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.938 V, which is 267, 90, 84, and 66 mV higher than that of OC (E1/2 = 0.671 V), NiNx/OC (E1/2 = 0.848 V), FeNx/OC (E1/2 = 0.854 V), and the benchmark Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.872 V), respectively. In addition, the observed ORR limiting current densities of ≈6.4, ≈6.1, and ≈5.9 mA cm−2, respectively, from Fe/NiNx/OC, NiNx/OC, and FeNx/OC are larger than that from Pt/C (≈5.1 mA cm−2), reflecting the superior mass transfer properties of the trimodal-porous carbon structures. The excellent ORR activity of Fe/NiNx/OC can be further evidenced by its smallest Tafel plot slope (59.9 mV dec−1) among all the investigated samples (Figure 3b). The ORR kinetic current density (Jk) of Fe/NiNx/OC at 0.90 V is found to be 28.1 mA cm−2, 15.1 and 109 times of that for FeNx/OC (1.87 mA cm−2) and NiNx/OC (0.258 mA cm−2), respectively, and also much higher than that of Pt/C (2.39 mA cm−2). An average transferred electron number (n) of 3.96 can be determined from the Koutechy–Levich (K–L) plot derived from the corresponding voltammograms of Fe/NiNx/OC (Figure 3c), signifying a four-electron ORR pathway, which is consistent with the RRDE measurement results (Figure S20a, Supporting Information). The acidic ORR performances in 0.1 m HClO4 were investigated (Figure 3d). Impressively, Fe/NiNx/OC also exhibits an outstanding acidic ORR activity with a E1/2 of 0.840 V, which is 335 and 64 mV higher than that of NiNx/OC (E1/2 = 0.505 V) and FeNx/OC (E1/2 = 0.776 V), and only 21 mV lower than that of the benchmark Pt/C (E1/2 = 0.861 V). The superior acidic ORR activity of Fe/NiNx/OC can be further evidenced by its smallest Tafel plot slope (60.1 mV dec−1) among all the samples investigated, including the benchmark Pt/C (Figure 3e). A four-electron acidic ORR process is confirmed by the K–L plot (Figure 3f) and RRDE measurement results (Figure S20b, Supporting Information). The above experimental results demonstrate that in both alkaline and acidic media, the coexisting Fe and Ni SAs in Fe/NiNx/OC possess superior ORR activities than that of FeNx/OC and NiNx/OC with only Fe- or Ni-SAs, which could be due to the h-SA-induced synergetic effect. Density functional theory calculations were carried out to gain further insights into the relationship between h-SA coordination configuration and ORR performance (please see the Supporting Information for details). The acquired results (Figure S21, Supporting Information) unveil the transfer of charges from Ni atom to Fe atom through the conjugated π bond of graphene, indicating that such long-range interaction between adjacent NiN4 and FeN4 could collectively modulate the electronic structure of Fe in FeN4 to further increase ORR activity.[6, 12, 24] The achieved ORR performances by Fe/NiNx/OC in both alkaline and acidic media exceeded the recently reported high performance Fe- and Ni-based electrocatalysts (Table S4, Supporting Information).

The effect of hierarchical porous structure on the ORR performance was also investigated using Fe/NiNx/OCs with different sizes of macropores in O2-saturated 0.1 m KOH (Figure 3g). The Fe/NiNx/Cs (1.4 µm) without ordered macropores and mesopores exhibit poor ORR activity with a E1/2 potential of 0.855 V and a limiting current density of ≈4.2 mA cm−2 due to the poor mass transport conditions. The Fe/NiNx/OC-281 possesses large-sized macropores, hence the superior long-range mass transport capability, however, it also exhibits poor ORR activity (E1/2 = 0.842 V) than that of Fe/NiNx/OC with 180 nm macropores, which is due to the significantly reduced mesoporous structures (mesopore volume = 0.221 cm3 g−1). The Fe/NiNx/OC-117 possesses abundant mesopores, but compared to Fe/NiNx/OCs with 180 nm macropores, its relatively small average macropore size of 117 nm leads to a decreased long-range mass transport capability, hence the decreased ORR activity.[19] These results confirm that an optimized 3D hierarchical porous structure of the carbon support is critically important to realize the full catalytic potentials of SAECs. In addition, the effect of Fe and Ni h-SA contents on ORR performance was investigated (Table S2 and Figure S22, Supporting Information). Obviously, Fe/NiNx/OC possesses a minimal ORR overpotential, indicating that an optimum ORR activity could only be achieved when both Fe/Ni ratio and h-SA contents are optimized.
Both alkaline and acidic stabilities of Fe/NiNx/OC were evaluated by the voltammetric (Figure 3h,i) and chronoamperometric tests (Figure S23, Supporting Information). The characteristics of the recorded voltammograms over 5000 cycles from both alkaline and acidic media are almost unchanged, signifying the superior cycling stability of Fe/NiNx/OC. For the chronoamperometric tests over a period of 30 000 s, an ≈95% and 92% original current densities are retained, respectively, from alkaline and acidic media, demonstrating the superior long-term stability of Fe/NiNx/OC. Impressively, the highly ordered porous structure of Fe/NiNx/OC can be well maintained after the above long-term stability test (Figure S24, Supporting Information). Furthermore, negligible ORR current decay can be observed after the addition of methanol into 0.1 m KOH electrolyte, confirming a high methanol tolerance ability of Fe/NiNx/OC (Figure S25, Supporting Information).
The performance of Fe/NiNx/OC as the cathode material in rechargeable Zn–air battery and proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) under H2–O2 and H2–air conditions were evaluated (Figure 4). As illustrated in Figure S26 (Supporting Information), the Fe/NiNx/OC also exhibits superior activity and stability toward oxygen evolution reaction comparable to IrO2. As a result, the Zn–air battery with Fe/NiNx/OC-based air cathode can achieve a high open-circuit voltage of 1.525 V (Figure S27a, Supporting Information) and a peak power density of 148 mW cm−2 at 210 mA cm−2, which is 1.63 times of that achieved by Pt/C-based cathode (91.0 mW cm−2 at 150 mA cm−2, Figure 4b) and exceeds most of reported ORR electrocatalysts (Table S5, Supporting Information). The discharge curves shown in Figure S27b (Supporting Information) reveal that under a high current density of 50 mA cm−2, the Fe/NiNx/OC-based Zn–air battery can generate a specific capacity of 712 mAh g−1, larger than that of the Pt/C-based one (608 mAh g−1). As shown in Figure S27c (Supporting Information), an insignificant voltage loss from ≈0.98 to ≈1.07 V after 300 successive charge/discharge cycles under a current density of 20 mA cm−2 demonstrates a superior cycle performance of Fe/NiNx/OC-based cathode. For the PEMFC using H2–O2 as fuels, the open-circuit voltages of 0.96 and 0.95 V, and the maximum power densities of 0.58 and 0.36 W cm−2 are obtained under 1.0 and 0.3 bars, respectively, indicating a high ORR activity of Fe/NiNx/OC-based cathode (Figure 4c), outperforming the reported FeNC and MnNC catalysts.[9, 25] For the PEMFC using H2–air as fuels, a maximum power density of 0.21 W cm−2 is readily achievable (Figure 4c).

In summary, we have innovatively utilized a template method combined with wet-chemistry metal-ion impregnation and pyrolysis to controllably coanchored Fe- and Ni-SAs to an uniquely configured trimodal-porous carbon support with highly ordered macropores interconnected by mesopores via the FeN4 and NiN4 coordination bonds, and demonstrated the use of hetero-SA electrocatalyst to dramatically enhance ORR electrocatalytic activity and the device performance for Zn–air battery and PEMFC. Our experimental results revealed that collectively optimizing the catalyst's intrinsic activity and mass transport capability is an effective strategy for catalyst design. The findings of this work open an avenue to rationally design electrocatalysts for other reactions such as CO2 and N2 reduction reactions involving dissolved gas reactants.
