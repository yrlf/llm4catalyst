1 Introduction
Energy shortage has become one of the most challenging global concerns, which penetrates all walks of life. Various energy storage devices including lithium ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and their hybrids have been developed to conserve energy and to utilize intermittent energy sources. (1-3) The development of highly active electrode materials is the center subject for high-energy devices. (1, 2) In commercial lithium ion batteries, graphite is the dominant anode material because of its low cost, safety, low working potential close to that of Li metal, and high Coulombic efficiency. (4-6) Graphite has a layered structure and in a pristine state its interlayer spacing is 0.34 nm. During electrochemical intercalation reaction, the interlayer spacing of graphite expands to accommodate Li+ ions. In the fully charged state corresponding to the formation of LiC6, the interlayer spacing of graphite increases to 0.37 nm, equivalent to about 10% volume expansion. (7, 8) This large volume expansion is responsible for the loss capacity of graphite anode after long-time charge–discharge cycling. Extensive research has been devoted to solving this problem through structure modification of graphite. For example, porous graphite was prepared to buffer the volume change during cycling, (9) and more directly, the development of expanded graphite with large interlayer spacing was used to reduce volume change during cycling. (10-14) However, the overall process involves multiple steps of intercalation, washing, and high-temperature processing, and is thus a long process with high energy consumption and associated waste production. (15-19)
Cost reduction is crucial on the development of high-energy devices, (20, 21) and thus, it demands a facile, low-cost, and fast production method for electrode materials. Compared with conventional heating methods, microwave irradiation has the advantage of short processing time and less energy consumption, which can shorten the process time from hours to seconds. (22-24) In this work, we developed a one-step rapid synthesis route to produce modified graphite (MG) using microwave irradiation from partially oxidized graphite (oxidized by H2SO4 and KMnO4). The strong exothermic reaction involved in the process leads to additional benefit in producing functionalized MG.
2 Experimental Section
All chemicals, H2SO4, KMnO4, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), were used as purchased without further treatments. Natural flake graphite (average particle size of 100 μm) was purchased from Beijing Chemical Company in China. Typically, 1 g of flake graphite was mixed with 0.5 g of H2SO4 (98%). Different amounts of KMnO4 (0.07, 0.1, 0.13, or 0.15 g) was then added into the above mixtures with stirring in a glass beaker to form the final mixtures and allowed to react for 3 h. After that, the mixtures in the glass beaker were transferred directly into a microwave oven (Midea, made in China) and underwent microwave irradiation at 700 W for 30 s. During microwave irradiation, the volume of graphite mixture was found to increase rapidly, resulting in the formation of modified graphite (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). The morphology, structure, and phase composition of as-prepared sample were characterized by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S4800), transmission electron microscope (TEM, TECNAI G2), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Bruker D8 Focus).
Button battery was assembled to test the electrochemical performance of the resulted MG. Metallic Li served as anode, while the prepared MG electrode served as working cathode. A polypropylene membrane was used as the separator and 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC/DEC (ethyl carbonate/dimethyl carbonate/diethyl carbonate) solvent (1:1:1 vol %) served as electrolyte. The working electrode was prepared by blending modified graphite, carbon additive, and PVDF in mass ratio of 8:1:1 and NMP as solvent to form slurry. The slurry was then coated onto a copper foil and dried at 100 °C for 24 h. The mass loading of active materials is about 2 mg/cm2. The 2032-type cell was assembled in an argon (Ar)-filled glovebox. The galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were carried out by LANHE CT2001A cell tester.
3 Results and Discussion
Scheme 1a illustrates the synthesis process using microwave irradiation on partially oxidized graphite to produce MGs. First, H2SO4 and KMnO4 were intercalated into flake graphite interlayer by oxidation of carbon layer edge and the following ion diffusion. The following chemical reactions may occur during the oxidation step:

The dimanganese heptoxide (Mn2O7) and permanganyl cation (MnO3+) produced are strong oxidizing agents, which can oxidize graphite to form graphene oxide with various oxygen-containing groups (Scheme 1b). (14) In addition, C atoms were partially oxidized and thus removed from graphite sheets via reactions between C and MnO4–, Mn2O7, or MnO3+, for example, (14)

Under microwave irradiation, in situ formed gas molecules, for example, SO2 and O2, and other compounds, for example, Mn2O7, helped to further modify and break down the initial flake graphite.
Figure S1 shows the photographs taken at different reaction times during the microwave irradiation process. An electrical arc induced flame can be seen. The microwave irradiation on graphite produced high temperatures, which ignite the combustion of Mn2O7, a highly volatile and explosive compound. The volume of graphite was hugely increased, indicting the expansion and breaking down of graphite (Scheme 1a and Figure S2). After microwave irradiation, as-formed oxygen-containing groups were reduced and the final product consists of C defect and S-modified structures (Scheme 1b).
It has been reported that partially reduced graphene oxide can absorb microwave, leading to its rapid heating within 1–2 s. (22) This rapid heating process can promote atom doping on graphite sheet. During the oxidation stage, H2SO4 and Mn-based compounds were intercalated into the interlayer of flake graphite. With the application of microwave irradiation, the S- and Mn-modified graphites were in situ formed.
Figure 1 shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the original graphite and modified graphite samples. Table S1 summarizes the 2θ and corresponding interlayer spacing d002 of the main diffraction peak for all samples. The d002 value was found to decrease slightly from 0.339 to 0.334 nm with increased amount of KMnO4. The results indicated that the as-obtained products consist of a large piece of small-size graphites which were formed by microwave-assisted explosion reaction. Figure S3 shows the SEM images of MG samples. When the amount of KMnO4 is less than 0.10 g, layered graphite is clearly seen (Figure S3a,b). With increased KMnO4 amount, thin graphite nanosheets formed (Figure S3c,d). TEM image and SEAD pattern show that the MG samples display single-crystal characteristics (Figure 2a). The d-spacing value of (002) planes was 0.338 and 0.365 nm as shown in HRTEM (Figure 2b). At the edge of the nanosheets, the expanded graphite with large d002 value is formed. Figure S4 shows IR spectra of MG samples. It confirms that O- and S-containing groups are present on graphite sheets.

Elemental mapping was performed to show the atom distribution (Figure 2c–h). The final samples include C, S, O, and Mn elements, which indicated that S- and Mn-based compounds or the oxygen-containing functional groups can coexist on the MG basal plane (Figure S5). (25, 26) C/S and C/Mn ratios are 149 and 8, respectively (Table S2). The existence of these atoms can provide additional properties when applied in lithium ion batteries, for example, the formation of stable SEI on graphite anode.
The degree of graphite oxidation is expected to affect the microstructures of the as-resulted MG. It was reported that KMnO4-to-H2SO4 ratio affects the oxidation degree of graphite. (14) Increasing the KMnO4/H2SO4 ratio promoted the formation of Mn2O7 and MnO3+, which are responsible for the oxidization of graphite basal plane. A large amount of carbon defect sites would form on graphite during oxidation, which may act as locations for microwave-assisted expansion. In this work, the effect of H2SO4 addition (being 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g) on the resulted MG samples is also studied. As shown in Figure 3, a large amount of graphite nanosheets were found compared with that shown in Figure S2. With the addition of a lower amount of KMnO4 (<0.2 g), thick sheets proved that the expanding degree of graphite was lower (Figure 3a,b). Thinner nanosheets were present in the samples with the addition of more KMnO4 (Figure 3c–e), indicating the expanding degree of graphite was higher. When the amount of H2SO4 increased to 1.5 g, thin nanosheets were obtained with the addition of different amounts of KMnO4 (Figure 3f–j). EDS spectra also confirm the formation of O-, S-, and Mn-based doping (Figures S5 and S6).

Electrochemical performance of the MG samples was systematically evaluated as a lithium ion battery anode. Figure 4a shows the galvanostatic discharge–charge curves, showing both charge and discharge voltages of <0.5 V, which are consistent with the reported values. (27, 28) As shown in Figure 4b and Figure S8, the first discharge capacity of MG-0.1 was 710 mA·h/g, while the second discharge capacity decreased to 373 mA·h/g, a value very close to the theoretical capacity of 372 mA·h/g. The first discharge voltage is higher than that in the charge process (Figure 4c), indicating the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI). (29, 30) In addition, the capacity loss in the second cycle is also due to the formation of SEI. Figure 4b shows cycling performances of tested samples at a current density of 100 mA/g. The first discharge capacities of all samples can reach 700–800 mA·h/g. After 400 charge–discharge cycles, flake graphite anode shows a capacity of 193 mA·h/g. The capacities of MG-0.07, MG-0.10, MG-0.13, and MG-0.15 are 249, 371, 280, and 214 mA·h/g, respectively, displaying high capacity and cycling stability compared to flake graphite. It should be noted that pure flake graphites used in this work have the average particle size of 100 μm, which is higher than that often used in the literature. After microwave irradiation, their electrochemical performance can be significantly enhanced.

(a) Galvanostatic discharge–charge curves after 200 cycles, (b) cycling performance at a current density of 100 mA/g, (c) first galvanostatic discharge–charge curves, and (d) cycling performance at a current density of 200 mA/g.
The cells were also evaluated at the current density of 200 mA/g for long-time life testing. The capacity of MG-0.1 sample can stay at 370 mA·h/g after 410 charge–discharge cycles (Figure 4d). It should be noted that capacity fluctuation during the cycle is due to the temperature fluctuation. The formation of nanographite from flake graphite and expanded graphite edge contributes to increased capacity. In situ formed O-, S-, and Mn-based groups on graphite sheets may help the formation of stable SEI, leading to high cycling performance. Electrochemical performance of the MG samples synthesized with the addition of more H2SO4 and KMnO4 was also studied. As shown in Figure S9, all samples displayed high cycling stability after 200 charge–discharge cycles. Samples with a large amount of both H2SO4 and KMnO4 showed low capacities. However, the capacity of MG-0.4 sample with the addition of 0.15 g of H2SO4 can reach 460 mA·h/g (Figure S9), which is higher than all other samples, because of the formation of graphene structure. The improved cycling stability was attributed to the formation of stable SEI film on graphite anode with the help of S and Mn doping. (31-33) The present results confirm that modifying the surface of graphite in the synthesis process can enhance their final electrochemical performances. (34, 35)
4 Conclusions
In summary, microwave irradiation was used to in situ modify the partially oxidized graphite (oxidized by KMnO4 and H2SO4), leading to the production of S-modified graphite samples. As tested for lithium ion batteries, the modified graphite materials displayed the high reversible capacity of 373 mA·h/g at a current density of 100 mA/g, approaching the theoretical value of 372 mA·h/g. The capacity of 370 mA·h/g was obtained even after 410 charge–discharge cycles. The high capacity and excellent cycling stability can be attributed to the formation of nanographite from flake graphite, expanded graphite edge, and stable SEI film. This method provided a rapid and low-cost route to synthesize high-performance graphite-based electrode materials for energy storage.
