EGC//NCM811 full cell shows a firm capacity retention rate and durable cycling behavior.
The slow kinetics and lithium deposition of graphite anode are considered the key limitations of fast-charging lithium-ion batteries. Expanded graphite has shown tremendous potential for the improvement of rate performance due to its massive active sites released and lifted lithium storage platform. However, the risk of structural collapse caused by fast charging will reduce the cycling life of the expanded graphite anode. Herein, this study designed a stable structure of expanded graphite by filling its layer pores with pitch-derived soft carbon (EGC). The honeycomb-like EGC is a great fast-charging candidate material with rich active sites, enlarged ion transport channels, and efficient ion transport interfaces. As the experimental and simulation results, the EGC electrode demonstrated significantly fast lithium-ions storage kinetics and durable long cycle life, compared to commercial fast-charging graphite anode. Notably, the EGC//LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cell delivered a superior fast-charging and stability performance (near 20 min charging for 80 % State of Charge). The simple multifunctional modification strategy for graphite anode in this work provides a new approach for superior fast-charging lithium-ion batteries.

The widespread use of lithium-ion batteries has brought great convenience to people's lives [
1
,

]. However, the capacity degradation and safety hazards under extreme charging conditions seriously hinder the further commercial promotion of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [
3
,
4
]. Hours of waiting time have raised concerns about the convenience of electric vehicles. The choice between electric vehicles and traditional fuel motorcars is a tough assignment. Various endeavors have been undertaken to enhance the fast-charging performance of LIBs, primarily focusing on material advancements [
5
,
6
], battery engineering [
7
,
8
], and charging protocols [
9
]. Among these, material-based enhancements are pivotal, especially the graphite anode material [
10
]. The sluggish interfacial kinetics and low lithium insertion potential of graphite anodes can induce detrimental lithium deposition, including the formation of lithium dendrites [
11
]. This results in irreversible lithium consumption and poses potential safety hazards. Therefore, the modification of graphite is generally considered one of the most important directions to improving the fast-charging performance of LIBs [
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
].
The modified graphite for fast-charging purposes can be classified into three main categories: coating, path optimization, and layer expansion. By coating graphite grains with species that gifted functions of lithium affinity [
15
], Li plating inhibition [
16
], and induction effect of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) [
17
,
18
], the energy barrier of graphite anode is significantly decreased, but it is confined to surface rather than intrinsic improvements. By designing ordered arrays [
19
], pore gradients [
20
], and etching channels [
21
], the ion transport path in graphite anode can be effectively shortened [
22
], but these complex engineering methods are not conducive to industrial mass production. Layer expansion strategies, such as expanded graphite (EG) [
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
], graphite oxide frameworks (GOFs) [
26
,
27
], and exfoliated graphene [
[28]
,
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
], have attracted more attention. Lee et al. [
26
]. suggests an optimum interlayer spacing (near 0.74 nm) for fast-charging graphite anode, based on the research results in terms of the Li+ transport barriers of GOFs with different expanded spacing. They believe layer materials with over-expansion are adversed to fast charging. Unlike GOFs, the layers of EG are not enlarged by an equal amplitude, but they can maintain a long-range order like graphite [
33
]. The layers of EG expanded into micropores and macropores provide more design space, while the partially retained graphite structure makes it more practical. Therefore, EG has significantly influenced contemporary electrode design, particularly for scenarios involving large-radius charge carriers and applications necessitating confinement structures. However, excessive layer expansion fractures the interlayer van der Waals forces and enormously increases the specific surface area of graphite. Plentiful SEI lurks the hazards of structural rupture and regeneration during cycling, which count against the long-term cycle stability of batteries [
26
]. The strategic choice of effective fillers for EG layer pores constitutes a critical task that holds substantial significance in enhancing the performance and durability of the anode. The potential fillers can be divided into three types, active materials [
25
,
34
,
35
], interface modification substances [
36
], and pillars [
37
]. The filling reform in existing research has not yet allowed EG to reach the practical application level in the fast-charging aspect. Soft carbon is a potential species that has not yet been used as a filler. Soft carbon, as a surface-driven energy storage material, has been proven to be suitable for energy storage as a fast-charging anode materials, with special kinetics promotion effects [
38
]. The application advantages of soft carbon for fast-charging modification can be briefly summarized: (1) the structure retains several graphite microcrystals with high regularity, resulting in its high conductivity; (2) the working voltage window of soft carbon (from 0.2 to 1.2 V) is far away from the forming potential of lithium dendrites, indicating its low potential risk; (3) the lower cost and simple preparation process allow soft carbon widely favored for commercialization.
In this work, a honeycomb expansion layer structure with robust mechanical integrity was prepared by the pitch-derived soft carbon embedded into the layer pores of EG. The innovative structure increased lithium-ion transport channels to boost ion diffusion kinetics. The various macropores and mesopores in EG and rich edge-defect in soft carbon offer EGC with extra capacity, which not only provides active sites but also keeps the energy storage platform away from lithium deposition potential in fast-charging operation. As a result, the well-designed EGC anode assumes excellent fast-charging capability than commercial fast-charging graphite-based anode. These results will be characterized and analyzed in detail in the following text, and further confirmed through theoretical calculation results. For its practical significance, an EGC//NCM811 full cell shows a firm capacity retention rate (near 20 min charging for 80 % of the full capacity) and durable cycling behavior.
To highlight the excellent rate performance of EGC, the widely used artificial graphite (commercial grade, for fast charging applications, grade BFC–H21) was acquired from Shenzhen BTR (China).
Expandable graphite (commercial grade, 325 mesh) was obtained from Qingdao Teng Sheng Da (China). Then EG got from a heating process in a microwave oven at a power of 700 W for 20 s.
Soft pitch (commercial grade, general purpose, mid-temperature grade 80#, softening point 80 °C) was purchased from Wuhan Baohua (China). Shake well 4.0 g soft pitch powder with 0.2 g EG, and carry by a porcelain boat, then heat by a tube furnace with argon atmosphere. Ramp the temperature up to 140 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1, and last for 2 h, then increase the tube temperature to 800 °C and hold for another 2 h.
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on an 18 KW D/MAX2500V PC diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 1.54 Å) radiation at a scanning rate of 10° min−1. A Veruis 5 UC field emission scanning microscope was used for the electron scanning electron microscopy (SEM). High performance-focused ion beam dual-beam electron microscope (FIB-SEM) was implemented to test the inner structure of EG and EGC. On a JEM-F200 transmission electron microscope, TEM and HRTEM were carried out. On a Thermo ESCALAB XI+, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were collected using Al K (h = 1486.8 eV) as the excitation source. By reference C 1s to 284.8 eV, the binding energies discovered from XPS spectra analysis were adjusted for specimens. Using a Raman microscope, Raman spectra were captured at ambient temperature. Utilizing X-ray micro-computed tomography, micro-CT was studied. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and VERTEX 70 V. TGA data were acquired from 40 °C to 800 °C in an argon gas environment using a synchronous thermal analyzer (TGA/DSC3+, Mettler). The simulation of the carbonization process adds an extra holding process to this program. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, VERTEX 70 V) was used to analyze the surface-functional groups. The specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET) theory and the pore size distribution was calculated by a density functional theory method (Micromeritics ASAP 2020HD instrument) at liquid-nitrogen temperature based on the BET model.
Electrodes were fabricated by mixing EGC, Super P, and sodium alginate at a weight ratio of 7:2:1, then coated uniformly (doctor-blade) on a copper foil with a mass loading of ∼1.5 mg cm−2. The electrodes were dried at 80 °C under a vacuum for 12 h. Electrochemical tests were carried out using a coin cell configuration, CR2016, which was assembled in an Ar-filled glovebox with oxygen and moisture concentrations kept below 0.01 ppm.
Li foil used as a counter electrode was separated from the working electrode using a polyethylene separator (ND16, SK Innovation Co.). The electrolyte was 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate (EC: DEC = 1:1) and 10 % fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed on a VSP electrochemical workstation (Bio Logic, France). Galvanostatic charge/discharge was performed in a voltage range from 0.01 to 2.0 V on a Land CT 2001A battery testing system (Land, China) at room temperature.
The simulation calculations in this work were based on the density functional theory (DFT) with the gradient exchange-correlation function of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) function. D3 method, 450 eV cutoff, two-electron iterative and conjugate gradient algorithms.
The structure design conception of the EGC anode was displayed in
Fig. 1
a, an expanded graphite filled with fluffy soft carbon which allows lithium ion to intercalate into graphite quickly. To successfully obtain the objective EGC structure by experiment method, it is necessary to select an appropriate graphite host and soft carbon precursor. Commercial EG can achieve the desired inflated structure and exhibit an appropriate specific surface area. This study selected marketed expandable graphite and further processed it using a microwave heating source. Under the function of instantaneous high-energy microwave, expandable graphite rapidly gasifies interlayer compounds, generating a thrust along the c-axis direction. The thrust expands the layers by tens to hundreds of times. EG appears a worm-like shape which is known as “graphite worms” with sizes of several hundred micrometers (
Fig. S1
). This loose expansion layer pore facilitates ion diffusion and allows for more design possibilities. Meanwhile, pitch which has melt-impregnation characteristics been used as a redesign material to conduct layer pores filling actions in subsequent heat treatment [
[39]
,
[40]
,
[41]
]. Pitch is a complex organic mixture that can be melted and carbonized in an inert atmosphere to obtain slightly graphitized soft carbon. The pitch undergoes some changes such as evaporation, pyrolysis, and thermal shrinkage during carbonization. As a commercial product, the softening point of medium temperature pitch is known (80 °C). To achieve the best flowing result, a study in terms of the melting characteristics of the raw pitch has been conducted, as shown in
Figs. S2a–f
. The heat treatment process of pitch is divided by the boundary temperatures of 300 °C, 450 °C, and 550 °C. The pyrolysis mainly occurs at 450 °C–550 °C. A continuous heat treatment process including pitch melt-impregnation and carbonization shrinkage has been employed. The residence program at its melting point allows the pitch to fill and level off the EG pore walls. Then, by the low-temperature carbonization, soft carbon with an amorphous structure is obtained. The amorphous-dominated soft carbon with a large number of defects, pores, and residual functional groups allows for rapid and reversible intercalation of lithium ions [
42
]. According to the initial feeding ratio, EG only accounts for a small portion of the mass of EGC composition. As shown in
Fig. S3
, the proportion of pitch-derived carbon (86.94 %) in the obtained product EGC is much higher than that of EG.

(A colour version of this figure can be viewed online.)
First of all, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technology has been employed to visually determine the successfully synthesized EGC structure.
Fig. 1
b–c and S4a-b compared the morphology of EGC with the commercial-grade graphite BFC–H21. The designed EGC delivered a worm-like morphology with sizes of several hundred micrometers (similar to EG), but the depth of field in its pores is inapparent which emerges a denser and opaque texture. The morphology image indicates that the pores of EG are filled with pitch-derived carbon and the initial shape remains intact broadly. To further confirm this result, X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM) were used to study the inner structure of EGC. Micron-sized EGC could precisely achieve non-destructive 3D imaging using micro-CT, as shown in
Fig. 1
d–g. The unique honeycomb structure is revealed in the refactoring techniques based on multi-angle imaging. The FIB-SEM image in
Fig. 1
h testified to such information. The loose surface wrinkles are the original EG structure, while the massive carbon layer with fewer pores comes from pitch carbonization. The carbonized pitch components are closely attached to EG skeletons, demonstrating the effectively encapsulated effect between pitch-derived carbon and EG. The existence of abundant interconnected pores and their thickened pore wall implied the ion transport channels and anchoring sites consolidated by pitch carbonization. The pitch-derived carbon is embedded in the subsurface of the pores wall of expanded graphite with a micron-scale self-flow filling block, suggesting the independent pitch particle distribution before melting. The surface pores of expanded graphite screen the pitch particles, preventing them clustered excessively. The unique structure means that the pitch adheres to the EG pores wall with a tiny spots style and flows flat to fill blocks during the melting and temperature-holding process. To further explore the orderliness of the unique structure and confirm the species type of carbonized pitch, high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of EGC were obtained (
Fig. 1
i–j). The diffraction fringe image in
Fig. S5
displays the interlayer space of EGC is 0.353 nm, narrower than that of EG, and wider than artificial graphite (∼0.334 nm). The moderate layer expansion would boost the lithium-ion transport kinetics during intercalation. Notably, the spacing fluctuation of the diffraction fringe is tiny, demonstrating the crisscross stack between EG and soft carbon. The translucent shadow and lattice stripe spacing in
Figs. S6a–b
are direct to the industrial coating in BFC–H21. The tenuous coating layer has a higher transmittance and consists of crystalline and amorphous regions. Different from the commercial large-scale regular graphitic structure, EGC exhibits a coexistence lattice characteristic of vast areas of slightly graphitized carbon (from soft carbon) and a handful of graphitized carbon (residual graphite structure in EG). The HRTEM image implies the generation of soft carbon, consistent with the characteristics of pitch-derived soft carbon in the literature [
38
,
42
]. The above experimental results confirmed that the honeycomb-shaped gradient carbon structure with numerous internal connecting pores has been successfully synthesized, which could exhibit superior fast-charging performance in LIBs.
To gain a deeper understanding of the active sites in EGC, an N2 isothermal adsorption-desorption experiment has been conducted. A combination of type II, IV, and VI isotherms with type H4 hysteresis loop in
Fig. 2
a suggests that EGC is a mesoporous multilayer adsorbent material. The absence of the saturated adsorption platform demonstrates the inhomogeneity of the pore size distribution. This result is consistent with the aperture distribution in
Fig. 2
b. The EGC structure has been further confirmed to contain a large number of mesopores with different pore sizes and a small number of macropores. The specific surface area of EGC is 6.42 m2 g−1, while BFC–H21 is 4.14 m2 g−1, suggesting EGC has a compromised porosity between graphite and expanded graphite. To confirm the structural features of EGC,
Fig. 2
c shows the Raman spectra movement of EGC composite compared to artificial graphite. The disappearance of the G-band verifies the layer expansion of the graphite host. The high-energy second-order peak (Dʹ) at 1620 cm−1, which is just a weak shoulder in the graphite curve, represents the hybridization effect of soft carbon and the common existence of disorder defect in the EGC structure. The intensity ratio of the D-band and G-band (ID/IG) was calculated to analyze the difference in the disorder degree of EGC and BFC–H21. The ID/IG of EGC is 0.93, while that of BFC–H21 is 0.37, indicating the high proportion of amorphous carbon inside EGC. The result corresponds to the former TG analysis of the carbonization process (86.94 %) and meets our original design intention. This observation is also consistent with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (
Fig. 2
d). The EGC sample holds a broad diffraction peak at 2 theta from 22° to 30° which is indexed to the (002) plane of graphite lattice which exists a tremendous amount of transition zone caused by expansion. The residual graphite (002) peak indicates the existence of soft carbon. Different degrees of expansion result in significant (002) peak shift signal responses. Therefore, the higher proportion of soft carbon does not significantly alter the structure of EG, as the gasification and shrinkage during pitch carbonization. This fact indicates that soft carbon is extensively distributed on the surface of EG mesopores with the role of microscale fillers.

To inspect the rest of the organic substance and further confirm the existence of soft carbon in EGC composite after carbonization, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) test have been exerted. As shown in
Fig. S8
, the lower onset points of the EGC decomposition curve are attributed to the amorphous carbon pyrolysis and further graphitization. This data can serve as another qualitative evidence for the existence of soft carbon. The FTIR spectrum in
Fig. S9
shows a significant difference between the wavelength from 500 cm−1–1000 cm−1, indicating the introduction of aromatic ring species which points to the complex organic components inherited from pitch. Low-temperature carbonized soft carbon contains some residual hydrogen capped aromatic fragments which can serve as binding sites for lithium ions. Peaking characteristics similar to graphite in other positions can be considered as evidence of the almost complete pyrolysis and volatilization of potential organic matter.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured to further understand the element composition and its bonding interaction in the balance state of EGC. The whole survey spectrum of EGC and BFC–H21 is displayed in
Fig. S10
. The strong O and C peaks comply with obvious carbonaceous characteristics. BFC–H21 has a lower C element ratio which can be attributed to the industrial coating modification of commercial artificial graphite for fast-charging purposes. The differences in the content of C and O elements can be deeply investigated from high-resolution XPS C 1s and O 1s peaks. The analysis between
Fig. 2
e–f and
Fig. S10
reveals the remarkable differences in composition and structure between EGC and BFC–H21. The absence of emblematic C=C bond and striking C=O bond in the EGC spectra is precisely evidence that it has not undergone any modification with other species after high-temperature carbonization. The final structural feature presented by EGC can be concluded: expanded graphite provides reaction and adsorption sites, while soft carbon focuses on interface optimization through defects, pores, and residual functional groups. By the dual design of extra active sites and interface energy barrier regulation, an EG redesign strategy for fast-charging applications is achieved.
CR2016 coin-type half-cell has been used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the EGC anode. In
Fig. 3
a, the electrochemical cycling capacity of EGC and BFC–H21 were investigated at a low current density of 0.2C (1C = 372 mA g−1). The reversible specific capacity of EGC performed to 359 mAh g−1 over 200 cycles, and BFC–H21 only achieved 300 mAh g−1.
Fig. 3
b displays the first cycle charging and discharging voltage profiles of EGC and BFC–H21. EGC obtains additional capacity gain with a certain initial Coulombic efficiency loss and exhibits a smooth and gentle slope rather than a flat platform like commercial graphite. The elevated electrochemical platform is beneficial for avoiding lithium deposition induced by polarization. By effectively controlling the degree of EGC expansion, the intercalation capacity of graphite can be maximally retained. The additional adsorption effect provides a capacity buffer. The symbiosis of intercalation and adsorption exhibits slope characteristics in the platform. To evaluate the practical application value of the capacity improvement, we evaluated the volume capacity density of EGC. However, layer expansion is a double-edged sword for volumetric capacity density. A slight increase in capacity is accompanied by a sacrifice in volume. Overall, the improvement in volumetric capacity density of EGC is not significant. To further confirm the kinetics improvement effect of this symbiotic effect, the electrochemical cycling stability test at the charging rates ranging from 0.1C to 5C. EGC electrode presents significant improvement, as shown in
Fig. 3
c. The faster kinetics performance can be attributed to the abundant reactive sites in the EGC structure, including pores, holes, opened edges, residual functional groups, and loose graphite interlayers. The role of soft carbon at the interface is also worth paying attention to. Corresponding discharging voltage profiles of EGC have been ordered in
Fig. 3
d. The intercalation ability of EGC decays less at relatively large cycle rates. The 1C long cycling performance in
Fig. 3
e has been investigated to confirm the heavy current charging stability of EGC. The results show that EGC can maintain a capacity of 305 mAh g−1 for over 600 cycles at 1C with almost 100 % capacity retention. We have tried to find the structural root of this stability from the perspective of the structure-activity relationship by comparing the morphological changes of the EGC anode before and after cycling. After working on a high current density of 1C for 600 cycles, the electrode structure remained intact, and the multi-scale pore structure without collapse, as shown in
Figs. S11a and b
.

To make clear the underlying causes of the superior electrochemical performance of EGC electrodes, the charge storage mechanism, and internal kinetics were further investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) test.
Fig. 4
a and d provide a contrast of the charge/discharge redox peaks for EGC and BFC–H21 at different scan rates ranging from 0.2 to 2.0 mV s−1 with a potential between 0.01 and 2.0 V (vs. Li/Li-ion). Compared to commercial graphite, EGC exhibits a significantly elevated redox reaction potential (up to 0.8 V at high sweep speed), which keeps away from the risk of lithium deposition. Compared to BFC–H21, EGC has low resolution in both oxidation and reduction peaks. This result demonstrates parts of the adsorption process mingled with (de)-intercalation process. In general, EG is a kind of species with a high specific surface that exhibits significant adsorption effects. The possible impacts of pseudocapacitive, such as boosting the potential, accelerating ion transport, and increasing capacity cannot be ignored. According to the Randles-Sevick equation, in terms of the electrochemical reactions involving free diffusion redox (a diffusion-controlled process), the peak current (Ip) linearly correlated with the square roots of the scanning rate (ν1/2). In other words, by studying the linearly dependent between Ip and ν1/2, the charge transport mechanism can be determined whether capacitance- or diffusion-controlled. A specific factor, b-value, which is the linear correlation coefficient of Ip versus ν1/2, has been used as a criterion. As shown in
Fig. 4
b and e, like BFC–H21, the Ip and ν1/2 curves of EGC can perfectly fit into a straight line indicating that it is also dominated by diffusion control. Meanwhile, the b-value of EGC (0.61) is larger than that of BFC–H21 (0.25), illustrating the higher ion diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, the pseudocapacitive contribution in different sweep speeds can be calculated by the fitted outcomes. The contribution ratio of the capacitive- and diffusion-controlled process of EGC and graphite BFC–H21 at a typical scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 (vs. Li/Li+) is listed in
Fig. S12
, suggesting a significant capacitive contribution.
Fig. 4
c and f then present the visually summarized results by using a bar chart. The contribution ratio of EGC and BFC–H21 at 1.0 mV s−1 is 69.0 % and 55.2 %, respectively. The difference is caused by the surface-driven energy storage mechanism of EGC, indicating its potential to supply additional active sites.

And the responsive fitted line at different redox voltages and the calculated total capacity contribution ratio of EGC (b and c) and BFC–H21 (e and f). (A colour version of this figure can be viewed online.)
The reasons for the difference in performance between EGC and BFC–H21 were further determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The fresh and after-cycling half-cell has been used to evaluate the ion diffusion ability. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) and Warburg coefficient(σ) are two important evaluation parameters in EIS testing. In the high-frequency region of the EIS curve, the endpoint of the convex semicircle is the characteristic signal of Rct. As shown in
Fig. S13a
, EGC has a higher impedance than native graphite in fresh cells, but its improvement during cycling is more significant. After 50 cycles, the impedance of EGC is slightly lower than that of BFC–H21 (see
Fig. 5
a). In the comparison of this parameter, EGC does not have an advantage due to Rct is strongly correlated with the interface. The exposed new interfaces of EGC will increase the impedance. The difference between EGC and graphite disappears following the volume expansion in the cycling, suggesting the EGC interface has good self-regulation ability which can be ascribed as a significant improvement compared to EG. Besides, σ describes the ion diffusion ability. The bigger Warburg coefficient implies slower solid ion diffusion. The real part of impedance (Z’) is correlated positively with the negative half power of angular velocity (ω−1/2) with a Warburg coefficient σ. Thus, the σ value could be gained from the fitted line of impedance spectrums (
Fig. S13b
). The Warburg coefficient of EGC during the fresh period is 360 Ω s−1, and BFC–H21 is 429.2 Ω s−1. After 50 cycles working, the data has dropped to 142.5 Ω s−1 versus 268.6 Ω s−1 (
Fig. 5
b). No matter before or after cycling, EGC owns lower σ compared with commercial graphite. The result illustrates that the diffusion rate of lithium ions in the intercalation process can be effectively improved by the designed unique structure of EGC, and this structure could also maintain the cycling stabilized of the EGC electrode. As a result, EGC anode exhibits dual function improvement both in fast-charging and cycling stability.

The superior lithium ions behaviors in EGC electrodes have been further revealed by the quasi-equilibrium galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT).
Fig. S14
shows the 46th cycle charging and discharging curves of GITT for EGC and graphite BFC–H21 anodes in LIBs. Each cycle lasts for 5 min at 0.1 A g−1 and then relaxes for 20 min. According to Fick's second law, the total ion diffusion coefficient can be calculated based on the voltage changes caused by pulses and the charging/discharging process.
Fig. 5
c and d shows the comparison of ion diffusion coefficient between EGC and graphite BFC–H21, EGC delivered higher lithium-ion diffusion coefficients than those of BFC–H21, explicating the preeminent ion diffusion kinetics of EGC.
To better understand the kinetics nature of EGC, the specific electronic motion behavior and bonding mode are further studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A simplified structural model of EGC and graphite was constructed, as shown in
Fig. S15
. Based on these two models, the computer-simulated their electron motion tendencies through the charge density difference calculations, as shown in
Fig. 5
e–f. For graphite, a single electron tends to anchor directly below the carbon atom. As For EGC, the filling soft carbon induces electrons to approach it while allowing them to rearrange the entire carbon framework nearby, significantly improving the activity of graphite crystal faces. As a result, the energy barrier of the redox reaction is notably reduced (see
Fig. 5
g), from 0.23 eV (graphite model) to lower 0.17 eV (EGC model), verifying the ideal exaltation effect and lower diffusion energy barrier on the kinetics of EGC anode.
The great electron transfer and ion diffusion behaviors investigations of lithium-ion revealed the superior energy storage performance of the EGC anode. Based on the above experimental and simulation research, the electrochemical performance data in the previous section can be traced back to its fountainhead in kinetics. The expanded layer structure, multi-level pores, and the optimized interface of EGC greatly improve the transport efficiency of lithium ions, and finally promote the reform of the fast-charging ability of LIBs.
To confirm the practical feasibility of EGC anode in fast-charging LIBs, a LIBs full-cell was assembled based on the basic principle like

b shows that the EGC anode has better cycling ability than commercial fast-charging grade graphite. With the current density of 170 mA g−1, EGC-contain full cell remains at 70.59 % capacity after 200 cycles.
Fig. 6
c–e presents the excellent fast-charging performance of the NCM811//EGC full cell. An initial capacity of 160 mAh g−1 was delivered under a current density of 3C (1C @ NCM811 = 170 mA g−1), and it remains 126 mAh g−1 after 50 cycles with a capacity retention of near 80 %, demonstrating its good reversibility during fast-charging operation. To evaluate the capacity improvement of EGC at different rates, a charging protocol was employed with different charging rates from 0.1C to 5C and fixing the discharging rate at 0.2C. The results show that EGC has an absolute advantage when charging at a high rate.

In conclusion, this work has successfully found a practical solution to resolve the fast-charging problem of graphite by designing a stable structure of expanded graphite by filling its layer pores with pitch-derived soft carbon (EGC). This honeycomb framework provides a great quantity of macropores, mesopores, and rich edge-defect sites, offering EGC with extra active reaction sites. This unique design creates an interface with a kinetics acceleration effect and keeps the lithium intercalation platform of EGC away from the lithium deposition potential in fast-charging operation. Thereby, the EGC electrode demonstrates an ideal fast-charging and cycling stability in half and full lithium-ion batteries. This work brings a new direction of developing fast-charging and durable graphite-based anode of practical LIBs.
