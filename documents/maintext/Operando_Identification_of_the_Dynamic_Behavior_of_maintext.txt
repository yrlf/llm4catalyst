Introduction
Hydrogen energy obtained by electrochemically splitting water is a very green and renewable energy source. (1−3) The sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) impedes the overall efficiency of water splitting. (4,5) Transition metal oxides (TMO) and their derivatives were considered to be the promising OER catalysts. (6−9) On the contrary, recently, defect engineering has budded as a new strategy for regulating the electronic structures and interface coordination, thus boosting the efficiency of diverse electrochemical reactions. (10−12) In particular, the spinel Co3O4 has been widely investigated owing to its mixed valence of cobalt. (13−18) Despite of the poor intrinsic activity of pure Co3O4, various modification strategies have been developed to enhance the OER activity, such as defect engineering with introduction of oxygen vacancy (VO). (16,19−26) However, the role of defects in catalyst materials has not yet been fully identified. VO-rich Co3O4 has been widely reported as advanced OER electrocatalysts, (27,28) the mechanism of which was preliminarily attributed to the enhanced electronic conductivity and more low-valence Co (Co2+) that formed. (26) Traditionally and in principle, higher oxidation states of metal sites have a governing role of the OER activities in transition metal compounds, yet the lower oxidation states of metal sites are relatively inactive. (13,29,30) However, according to the definition of defect, the formation of oxygen vacancy would lead to the decrease of the valence state of Co (i.e., lower Co3+/Co2+ ratio in Co3O4), but, surprisingly enhanced performance for OER beyond expectations was observed on VO-rich Co3O4. There seems to be irreconcilable contradictions, and the OER active sites remain elusive. In addition, the chemical environment of defective Co3O4 is more dynamically changeable during electrocatalysis with applied potential. (31,32) In this complicated case, what is the real active site for OER on the electrocatayst: defective Co3O4? What is the intrinsic role of VO in Co3O4 for OER? How is the dynamic behavior of VO during electrocatalysis?
Recently, (quasi-) operando techniques had been heavily anticipated to monitor the electrocatalysis process. (33−36) For example, Kornienko et al. performed operando Raman spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to illuminate the structure and function of a noncrystalline cobalt sulfide during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, identifying the in situ formed CoS2-like cluster as the active sites. (35) Liu et al. systemically investigated the influence of the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in during the OER process by quasi-operando XPS and operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), (37) demonstrating that the carbon atoms on CNTs near the carbonyl functional groups are active for OER. Thus, the dynamic evolution of surface structure of catalysts and the transformation of active center/intermediate could be confirmed by the comprehensive use of various operando characterization techniques. (38−40)
Herein, we constructed pure spinel Co3O4 and VO-rich Co3O4 as catalyst models to study the defect mechanism and investigate the dynamic behavior of defect sites during the electrocatalytic OER process by various operando characterizations. Operando EIS and cyclic voltammetry (CV) implied that the VO could facilitate the pre-oxidation of the low-valence Co (Co2+, part of which was induced by the VO to balance the charge) at a relatively lower applied potential. This observation confirmed that the VO could initialize the surface reconstruction of VO–Co3O4 prior to the occurrence of OER process. The quasi-operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and operando X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results further demonstrated the oxygen vacancies were filled with OH• first for VO–Co3O4, facilitated pre-oxidation of low-valence Co, and promoted reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediate Co–OOH•. This work provides insight into the defect mechanism in Co3O4 for OER in a dynamic way by observing the surface dynamic evolution process of defective electrocatalysts and identifying the real active sites during the electrocatalysis process. The current finding would motivate the community to focus more on the dynamic behavior of defect electrocatalysts.
Result and Discussion
Nocera’s group pointed out that the structurally strained, unstable Co(IV) sites on the surface of Co3O4 serve as active intermediate species for OER. (41) Earlier studies revealed the importance of the pre-oxidation of Co2+ in oxides for the OER. (42,43) Actually, the pre-oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+ or a higher oxidation state is a critical step to generate active Co–OOH• sites for OER. (44) To monitor the pre-oxidation process and understand the improved catalytic kinetics of OER on VO–Co3O4, operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were exploited. The pre-oxidation behavior of the Co species was investigated by CV first. As shown in Figure 1, the 1.25 V vs. RHE (anodic, A1) were identified as the pre-oxidation of Co2+ to Co3+, while the potentials at 1.47 (anodic, A2) and 1.40 V (cathodic, C) belong to the redox couple of Co3+/Co4+. The absence of the cathodic peak of the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ suggests that the surface of VO–Co3O4 underwent an irreversible surface reconstruction, evolving a stable catalytic surface for the subsequent OER. (45) As shown in Figure S1, to be specific, the anodic peak in the first cycle appears at 1.25 V for VO–Co3O4, suggesting a promoting effect of VO on the pre-oxidation of Co2+, which facilitates the subsequent formation of Co–OOH• intermediate species for OER. (46) Pre-oxidation behavior also exists in different electrolytes (0.1 M KOH and 0.1 M PBS, Figure S2) for VO–Co3O4. An active OER electrocatalysts should have appropriate affinity for the adsorbed OH• intermediates. (47) We supposed that oxygen vacancy might serve as the OH ions concentrator to enrich hydroxyl around Co sites for facilitating OH ions adsorption. Therefore, to investigate the evolution of reactants (adsorption OH•) on the Co sites of Co3O4 during OER, pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 were examined on the basis of the Laviron equation. (48,49) The steady redox currents all showed linear correlation with the square root of potential scan rates in CV (1 M KOH, 5 to 700 mV s–1, Figures S3 and S4). (48,49) As shown in Figure 1B, the larger Ks (redox constant) of VO–Co3O4 (0.32 s–1) compared with that of pure Co3O4 (0.29 s–1) indicates the higher binding strength of VO to the OH• intermediate. (50,51)

In order to identify the difference of intrinsic activity in the two Co3O4 catalysts with different concentrations oxygen defects, the specific activity (current per Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Figure S5) area or electrochemical active surface area (ECSA, Figure S6) of the electrocatalyts for OER was achieved. We normalized the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves with BET and ECSA, as shown in Figures S7 and S8, indicating the preferable catalytic performance on VO–Co3O4 and confirming that the intrinsic activity was improved due to the surface enriched oxygen vacancies. In addition, the good stabilities of pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 were illustrated in Figure S9.
EIS is a potentially useful experimental tool in probing the kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions and the properties of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. (52,53) To track the evolution of the adsorbed OH• intermediates around Co sites (M–OH•) of VO–Co3O4 during OER, operando EIS measurements were performed to get a deep understanding about reaction kinetics in different electrolyte solutions. Parts A and B of Figure 2 illustrate the Nyquist plots of the measured impedance of OER process on pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 in 1 M KOH from an open circuit potential (OCP) to 1.80 V. Combined with the corresponding Bode phase plots (Figure S10), these Nyquist plots were fitted with an equivalent circuit (Figure S11 and Tables S1–S6). (52−55) The adsorption behavior of the reactants (OH•) on the catalyst surface was described by RCT and CPECT, where RCT and CPECT represent the OH ions adsorption resistance and pseudocapacitance, respectively. (55,56) The changing trend of RCT and CPECT could reveal the OH• evolution on the catalyst surface during OER. Similar studies have been reported for H• evolution in the HER process. (55) Since pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 presented similar Rs values, the changes of total charge transfer resistance (defined as Rtotal) was dominated by RCT with the adsorbed OH• intermediate species during OER. Catalysts with small Rtotal suggest fast charge-transfer kinetics. The Rtotal of VO–Co3O4 is lower than that of pure Co3O4 beyond 1.15 V, demonstrating a much faster kinetics in adsorbed of OH ions during OER (Figure 2C). The surface of VO–Co3O4 was able to more easily adsorb hydroxide (or phosphate group in 0.1 M PBS, Figure S13C) because of the presence of oxygen vacancy.

(C) Response of the total charge transfer resistance (Rtotal) to the applied potential of Co3O4 samples. (D) Bode phase plots of pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 at 1.5 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH.
On the contrary, the OH ions’ faster accumulation induced by larger CPE should benefit the overall catalytic driving force. (57) As shown in the Bode phase plot at 1.5 V (Figure 2D, from Figures S12A,B), the phase peak a in the high-frequency region (102–104 Hz) and the phase peak b at the middle frequency region (100–102 Hz) were caused by the surface oxidized species with the Co–O6 Oh active site and Co–O4 Td active site, respectively. (50,57) Relative to pure Co3O4, the phase peak b positively shifted and phase peak a showed a lower phase angle for VO–Co3O4. The phase peak c for VO–Co3O4 can be observed in the Bode phase when applied potentials reached 1.50 V (vs RHE), which could be attributed to the faster deprotonation of Co–OOH•. (58) It is interesting to note that the same trend occurs in 0.1 M KOH (at 1.54 V) or 0.1 M PBS (at 1.605 V) when operando EIS was carried out, as shown in Figures S10–S13 and Tables S3–S6. Thus, the oxygen vacancy in VO–Co3O4 could act as the mediator to facilitate the OH ions adsorption with better charge transfer and faster deprotonation ability, correspondingly improving the catalytic kinetics in water oxidation.
The ex situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 were performed at several crucial potentials, as shown in Figure S14. The OER mechanism on metal oxide (such as Co3O4) indicated that the Co sites would be oxidized into the CoIII–OH species in the first step and would continue to be oxidized into CoIV–O species followed by the CoIV–OOH during OER. Previous studies proved that the surface CoIV sites act as key intermediates (CoIV–OOH) in the pathway for oxygen escape during water oxidation for cobalt oxides. (59,60) Compared with pure Co3O4, the stronger peak intensity of Co(IV)-containing species (g value at 2.23) for VO–Co3O4 shows that there is more Co(IV) coupling OOH• intermediate formation at 1.45 V (onset potential of OER) due to the presence of VO. (60) According to previous reports, (61) spin–spin and dipolar-broadening interaction between Co4+ species is the reason for the EPR signal intensity reducing and the effective g value shifting. So, the disappearance of the EPR signal related to Co4+ species at a potential of 1.75 V may be attributed to the Co4+ species increasing with the magnetically nondilute environment formed instead of Co4+ species disappearing. In addition, as shown in Figure S14A,B, the signal at the g value of 5 would be assigned to Co2+. (60,61) Furthermore, both of the signals for pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 reduced obviously after the oxidation potential was applied and the signal for VO–Co3O4 reduced more than pure Co3O4. Moreover, the stronger Co2+ species signal and weaker signal after the oxidation potential was applied for VO–Co3O4 than pure Co3O4 indicates that Co2+ species in VO–Co3O4 participate more easily than Co2+ species in pure Co3O4 in the pre-oxidation progress and formation of catalytic active sites, which are crucial for the OER. As well, this corresponds to the CV and LSV data and verifies the better catalytic performance of VO–Co3O4.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology evolution of electrocatalysts (Figure S15). Note that there is nearly no macroscopic change for both pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 under the OER. The quasi-operando X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to verify the changes in the crystalline structure in the OER process (Figure S16). The XRD patterns for both pure Co3O4 (Figure S16A) and VO–Co3O4 (Figure S16B) can be indexed to cubic spinel Co3O4 (JCPDS No. 43-1003). (19) The quasi-operando XRD patterns showed that the spinel structures of both were almost consistent through OER. Similar conclusions were observed by the operando Raman spectroscopy (Figure S16C,D). The Raman bands at ca. 197, 485, 524, 620, and 691 cm–1 can be indicated to the F12g, E2g, F22g, F2g, and A1g phonon modes of typically structured Co3O4, respectively. The Raman band at 197 cm–1 corresponds to F12g symmetry of tetrahedral sites (CoO4), which can be attributed to Raman vibration of Co2+–O2–. The band at 691 cm–1 can be ascribed to A1g species of octahedral sites (CoO6), which corresponds to Co3+–O2– Raman vibration. No obvious impurity phase was detected during OER.
Transmission election microscopy (TEM) images of two Co3O4 samples were taken before and after five CV tests and a 40 000 s i–t test (Figures S17–S19). The HRTEM images showed that they mostly maintained the crystal structure with little lattice mismatch, disorder, or reconstruction (in the OER process, pure Co3O4 may partially form amorphous CoOOH, and VO–Co3O4 would self-reconstruct to crystalline CoOOH).
We then investigated the near-surface (electronic) structure of two samples during OER by quasi-operando X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), a sensitive surface analytical tool (Figure S20). The high-resolution XPS spectra were collected to qualitatively analyze the Co valence state (Figure 3A, Figure S21 and S23, and Table S7). Compared with pure Co3O4, the relative content of Co2+ for VO–Co3O4 was increased and the rate of Co2+/Co3+ was 1.16 prior to electrochemical tests. This ratio continued to reduce for VO–Co3O4 when the applied potentials increased and maintained at about 0.95 (Figure 3A) until 1.25 V. However, for pure Co3O4, the ratio of Co2+/Co3+ showed a slow downward trend and maintained at around 0.75 eventually. Thus, active Co sites in VO–Co3O4 have more rapid OH ions adsorption and deprotonation ability than pure Co3O4 during OER. The results clearly inferred that oxygen vacancy induced low-valence Co2+ plays a key role in the OER process. (16)

Function of XPS fitting results of (A) Co2+/Co3+ relative content, (B) lattice oxygen (M–O) relative content, and (C) relative amount of surface oxygen vacancies for pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4. Error bars are standard deviations from three independent measurements. (D) Change of Co valence was included by the first derivative of main absorption edge (Co K-edge in XAS) with the applied potential.
The O 1s XPS spectra of pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 are shown in Figures S22 and S24, and fitting analysis results are shown in Figure 3B and Table S8. The O 1s spectrum curves fit with three peaks: O1, O2, and O3 (as shown in Figure S24). The O1 peak at approximately 530.0 eV corresponds to the lattice oxygen in metal oxide (Co–O). (62,63) The O2 peak at approximately 531.0 eV indicates the presence of surface chemisorbed oxygen such as O22– or O–, belonging to defect-oxide and hydroxyl-like groups. (62,64) The ratio of O2/O1 (peak area from Figure S24) can be a yardstick to estimate the relative amount of surface oxygen vacancies; a higher ratio indicates a larger amount of surface oxygen vacancies. (62,63,65,66) A small peak O3 at a higher binding energy of approximately 532.5–533.5 eV is attributed to unavoidable surface physically adsorbed/residual water molecules and/or carbon–oxygen bond in contaminated organic carbon. (67,68) The shift of binding energy in Co or O implies a change in the chemical state. For VO–Co3O4, Co binding energy shifts toward to a lower binding energy with the oxidation of cobalt (the relative content and average valence of Co3+ increases); however, O binding energy shifts toward to a higher binding energy. This behavior in pure Co3O4 was shown slowly due to its chemical stabilization. The metal–oxygen bond (defined as M–O) and the ratio of O2/O1 (relative amount of surface oxygen vacancies) for pure Co3O4 were relatively steady at about 55% and 0.61, respectively. However, the relative percentage of cobalt–oxygen bond (M–O) showed an inverse tendency (increase from 15% to 40%) for VO–Co3O4 during OER. On the contrary, the initial ratio of O2/O1 for VO–Co3O4 was about 5.4 and the ratio decreased quickly with the initial increase of applied potential and subsequently maintained at 1.1 from 1.45 V. It is believed that the VO in the VO–Co3O4 would be easily filled with OH ions to bond with Co sites to generate active Co–OOH• intermediate species during OER.
Similar trends were found in the Auger spectra of Co and O, coupled with XPS instruments (Auger–XPS), as shown in Figure S25. As dot lines guided, relative to pure Co3O4, the O KLL Auger peak position in VO–Co3O4 continued to shift to a higher kinetic energy when the applied potentials increased, indicating the continue oxidation of Co sites during OER. (69,70) Correspondingly, the Co LMM Auger peak position in VO–Co3O4 continued to shift to a higher kinetic energy, while Co and O Auger peak positions in pure Co3O4 showed slow responses. (70) We understand that the reduced valence state Co sites in VO-rich Co3O4 were more easily pre-oxidized. By combining the analysis of XPS O 1s results, we reasonably concluded that Co sites with a larger amount of surface VO in VO–Co3O4, in which cobalt sites easily adsorbed OH– and formed CoOOH with the applied potentials, increased. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the improved OER performance was directly relevant to VO in VO–Co3O4, which would facilitate the pre-oxidation of Co sites and induce the reconstruction of the defective surface at a low applied potential. (16)
X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were recorded at the Co K-edge of cobalt-based samples, as shown in Figure S26. The energy of the Co K-edge of VO–Co3O4 confirmed the lower Co oxidation state for VO–Co3O4 caused by VO. (16,26) To understand the reconstruction of the potential-dependent structure and oxidation state of the surfaces Co sites during OER process for the dynamic defect electrocatalysis mechanism, we performed operando XAFS during OER. Co K-edge data were collected under the critical potential (recorded at OCP to 1.75 V vs. RHE), as plotted in Figure 4A,B. It is well-known that XAFS can be used to evaluate the oxidation state of Co by the pre-edge feature or the main resonance of Co K-edge. With the first derivative of main absorption edge, as shown in Figure 3D, the raising absorption edge of main resonance is used to determine the Co valence change herein. With correlation to the O 1s XPS results, the oxygen defects have a significant affect on the oxidation of cobalt sites, especially at a low anode potential during OER. The edge peaks near 7719 eV for both pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 exhibit a positive shift with the increased applied potential from OCP to 1.75 V, indicating the oxidation of Co. (29,71) However, the different energy displacement trends indicate that the increase of the valence state of cobalt is different (Figure 4A,B). The increase in Co valence could be viewed as a deprotonation process on the reconstructed surface of the catalysts. (23) Before oxygen escapes, compared with the slow rise of the valence state of Co ions in pure Co3O4, the valence state of Co ions in VO–Co3O4 has a faster oxidation process. (23) When the anode potential continues to increase and surface charge cannot oxidize Co(IV) to a higher valence state, electrons are removed from surface oxygen, and this causes oxygen to escape accompanied by structural reconstruction. (23,72) According to the previous literature, (73) due to the stronger attraction of the Co sites for the O2p electron at a high anode potential, the deprotonation reaction of the medium OH– (M–OH•) becomes relatively easy. Thus, due to the enhanced electrophilicity of the exposed cobalt sites, VO is likely to promote the adsorption of the OH ions on the active Co sites to form adsorbed M–OH• species and subsequently prompt the deprotonation process at a low potential (i.e., 1.45 V) to form active oxygen species (Co–OOH•) on the surface, which accounts for the OER activity enhancement. (2,73−78) Thus, the surface chemistry of VO–Co3O4 is more easily changed by reconstruction from the oxide into Co–OOH• intermediate species. (79,80) This reconstruction of Co sites on the surface for VO–Co3O4 was also evidenced by EPR spectra (Figure S14) and quasi-operando XPS (Figure 3). It has been reported that Co–OOH evolved as the active species for many Co-based oxide catalysts during OER. (18) In brief, the VO would facilitate the surface reconstruction for evolving the active oxyhydroxide.

(C) Structural coherence change in the EXAFS coordination number of Co ions under an applied potential relative with the OCP state. Error bars were calculated as shown in Table S9.
To obtain quantitative structural parameters around Co atoms coordination under electrochemical reaction conditions, operando Co K-edge k3-weighted EXAFS spectra (Figure S27) and the corresponding Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectra (FT-EXAFS) fitting for pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 were displayed in Figure S28 and Table S9. As shown in Figure S28, the FT-EXAFS profiles for pure Co3O4 and VO–Co3O4 are similar. The peak at about 1.5 Å belonged to single scattering paths of the Co ion to the closest neighboring crystal oxygen (Co–O). Subsequent two separate peaks at 2.5 and 3.1 Å were assigned to the radial distances of CoOh (Co in octahedral site) and CoTd (Co in tetrahedral site) to their neighbor metal atoms, respectively. (57)Figure 4C showed the relative changes in various coordination surroundings around the crystal structure of cobalt sites in two samples during OER process. Prior to the occurrence of the OER process, the relative changes of coordination number (ΔN/N) of Co–O for VO–Co3O4 significantly immediately increased after immersion in the electrolyte at 1.15 V and then increased further with the increasing applied electrode potential. The largest ΔN/N was found at the onset of OER at 1.45 V. However, the ΔN/N of pure Co3O4 scarcely increased until the applied potentials reached 1.55 V. This result reveals the key role of oxygen vacancy on cobalt pre-oxidation and structural reconstruction in the OER process. Combined with the results of previous XPS and XANES experiments, these observations can be plausibly convinced of such a mechanism explanation that, due to the regulated surface electronic structure of catalysts by oxygen vacancy, the cobalt site of defective cobalt oxides (VO–Co3O4) could more effectively adsorb oxygen species (OH•) and more easily be oxidized and reconstructed. As the applied potential increased further up to 1.45 V, the ΔN/N of the VO–Co3O4 began to decrease, compared with the reaction with 1.55 V for the pure Co3O4. This phenomenon might have a lot to do with the evolution of oxygen species (M–OOH•), in which the electrons are removed from surface M–OOH• to remove protons and this causes oxygen to escape. So, compare dwith the pure Co3O4, obviously, because of regulation of surface Co sites by oxygen vacancy, VO–Co3O4 needs a lower potential to achieve deprotonation and oxygen evolution.
In addition, the ΔN/N values of Co–CoOh and Co–CoTd each exhibit unique trends. For pure Co3O4, the ΔN/N of the tetrahedral related cobalt sites (Co–CoTd) was changed only slightly, while the ΔN/N of octahedral cobalt sites (Co–CoOh) increased and decreased sharply near the onset potential of OER (1.6 V). On the contrary, the ΔN/N of the tetrahedral related cobalt sites (Co–CoTd) in the VO–Co3O4 showed a sharp increase during OER pre-oxidation (from OCP to 1.25 V), which was consistent with the change of the ΔN/N of Co–O, indicating the rapid filling of oxygen species (OH•) and the oxidation of Co sites. Thus, for the pure Co3O4, the oxygen species involved in OER process is mostly related to the octahedral cobalt coordination oxygen; however, the defect-regulated VO–Co3O4 was more related to the tetrahedral cobalt coordination oxygen.
By combining the above operando results, we concluded that the oxygen vacancy could significantly promote the formation of surface Co–OOH prior to and during the OER process, which boosted the OER activity. (16,81,82) Some previously reported theoretical calculations for the effect of oxygen vacancy showed that oxygen defect would reduce the band gap, increase the Fermi and HOMO levels of metal (hydr)oxide (MO or MOOH), and facilitate the reaction progression due to the enhanced binding strength of O• and OOH• intermediates. (16,28,67) To further clarify reconstruction of the spinel Co3O4 with/without oxygen vacancy during the OER process, the reaction mechanism was proposed on the basis of the above operando results to simulate the OER process and understand their structural evolution. (40) As shown in Figure S29, we proposed the unique influence of VO on the surface of Co3O4, which could regulate adsorption energy of OH– for Co sites and acts as an important intermediary for OOH• transfer to catalyze OER on VO–Co3O4. (47) The oxygen defects were more easily filled with OH• first on VO–Co3O4 and facilitated the pre-oxidation of Co sites and the reconstruction/deprotonation of intermediaries (M–OOH•).
Conclusion
In summary, we attempt unravel the dynamic process of defect electrocatalysis with VO-rich Co3O4 as a model catalyst by combining various (quasi-) operando techniques. Through operando characterization, we revealed that this unusual vacancy induction mechanism plays an important role in promoting catalytic oxidation. Operando EIS and CV measurements showed the lower charge transfer resistance, verifying that the intermediates Co–OOH• were reconstructed more easily for VO–Co3O4 prior to OER. Furthermore, quasi-operando XPS and operando XAFS revealed the dynamic evolution of the surface species of the defective electrocatalysts, illustrating the that VO facilitated the intermediates Co–OOH• deprotonation process at a lower potential. On the basis of above real-time (quasi-) operando characterizations, we proposed that VO-induced Co–OOH• intermediate species played a key role for OER. These results provide an insight into the dynamic surface structure–activity correlations for OER on VO–Co3O4 and suggest that the research on the mechanism of defect electrocatalysis should be performed in a dynamic way.
