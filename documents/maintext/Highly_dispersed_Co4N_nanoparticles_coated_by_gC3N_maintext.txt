Developing a cost-effective, efficient, and facile prepared electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reaction (OER) is critical for a range of renewable energy technologies. Herein, we report unique Co4N nanoparticles loading on g-C3N4 nanotubes (Co4N@CNNT) bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and ORR by an in-situ method. Highly dispersed Co4N nanoparticles as the active sites gather at the top of the g-C3N4 nanotube (CNNT), while the six-fold cavities from smooth CNNT with an outer diameter of 48 nm and an inner diameter of 22 nm act as anchor sites to preferentially coordinate with the active sites. Benefiting from the distinctive structure features, the intrinsic metallic Co4N@CNNT exhibits high electrocatalytic performances. Electrochemistry studies show that an onset potential of 0.94 V and a half-wave potential of 0.86 V of Co4N@CNNT are obtained that are superior to Pt/C catalyst. A low overpotential of 285 mV at an anodic current density of 10 mA cm−2 during the OER process is obtained that is superior to the IrO2 catalyst; and lower Tafel plot and good durability are also observed. Our findings provide a new strategy for the fabrication of an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and ORR.
The Co4N nanoparticles coated by 1D conductive g-C3N4 nanotube was synthesized by an in-situ and facile process. The bifunctional electrocatalyst shows excellent OER and ORR electrochemical activity superior to that of the referenced catalyst.

Electrochemical reduction and evolution of oxygen is a key process for many energy conversion or storage devices, such as fuel cells and metal-air batteries. The replacement of the costly precious metal catalysts used for electrochemical reactions is highly urgent, due to their scarcity in the Earth’s crust and other issues including stability and activity
[1]
,
[2]
. To date, many platinum-group-metal (PGM)-free catalysts, such as nitrides, oxides or oxynitrides, and carbonitrides have been developed
[3]
,
[4]
. Among these, transition metal nitrides (TMN) have been the most promising candidate materials since their first use as catalysts in 1973, due to the special electronic structure and high conductivity
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
. Usually, nitrides are interstitial compounds in which nitrogen atoms reside in the interstices of a metal lattice
[5]
. They present three crystal phases including face-centered cubic, hexagon close-packed, and hexagonal simple, which is related to the extent of the interstitial position of transition metal lattice occupied by the small nitrogen atoms
[6]
,
[7]
. The intrinsic electrochemical activities of transition metal nitrides depend strongly on their parent metal and crystal phases
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
. For example, bulk molybdenum nitrides (δ-MoN, Mo5N6, MoN, and γ-Mo2N) were investigated to explain the structure effect on ORR activities, and it was shown that the hexagonal phase has a higher activity than the cubic phase due to the higher oxidation state of Mo and the presence of redox-active 3d transition metal
[10]
. Intense efforts have been undertaken to further analyze their phases and corresponding electrocatalytic activities, such as WN
[11]
, FeN
[12]
, and NiN
[13]
.
Unlike the bulk structure, nanoscale nitrides show diametrically opposed electrochemistry reaction results. Recently, cubic phase WN atomic clusters were prepared with excellent ORR performance, suggesting that their activity and stability are positively correlated with the cubic phase and the small size
[14]
. Yuan et al. proved that cubic phase ZrN nanoparticles are an excellent electrocatalyst, because its low index plane is the most stable with a similar oxygen adsorption energy to that of Pt (1 1 1) surface
[15]
. Usually, face-centered cubic nitrides have a high content of nitrogen atoms resulting in a large expansion of the metal lattice to broaden transition metal d-band to produce a greater density of states that leads to electronic properties analogous to those of noble metals
[6]
,
[16]
. In addition to the electrocatalytic activity, the nanoscale dimensions also change the conductivity due to the changes in the bandgap and the small nanoparticles only partially mitigate the insulating character of the material. Xiao et al. synthesized hexagonal nitrides with metallic nature showing high conductivity, which changes the intrinsic properties of the nitrides. This is because the large-size nanosheets with subnanometer thickness do not have a bandgap and the high electron density of states at the Fermi level is due to the d electrons of the metal atoms
[17]
.
Consequently, the face-centered cubic phase Co4N nanoparticles may be a promising alternative for use as a catalyst in electrochemical reactions. However, most reports focus on the Co-N-C compounds due to their active Co-Nx moieties
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]
,
[21]
. Although the catalytic mechanism of oxygen for Co-N-C type catalysts is not clear, it is clear that the formed cobalt-based species including cobalt oxides or cobalt nitrides act as the active sites to enhance electrochemical performance, such as Co-N-C catalysts
[18]
, Co2N nanoparticles embedded in N-doped mesoporous carbon
[19]
, and CoxN/C
[20]
. The results obtained for all of these catalysts suggest that the enhanced ORR performance is due to the high electrocatalytic activity of the active sites Co-Nx species and the support graphitic carbon. Recently, single-phase Co4N nanoparticles were prepared to act as the ORR or OER catalyst with excellent catalytic activities due to their special electronic structure
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
. Yang and co-workers reported a cubic phase Co4N/C catalyst with the formation of a conductive nitride-core active oxide-shell structure, demonstrating that the special core–shell structure and conductive carbon acting as the support significantly promote the ORR performance
[21]
. Co4N nanoparticles can also be used as an OER catalyst because their d-band center is close to the optimal energy level for OER. Chen et al. synthesized metallic Co4N inside a thin cobalt oxide and/or hydroxides shell structure loaded on a carbon cloth OER catalyst, and stated that the core–shell nanowire structure provides the active sites
[22]
. However, the preparation of bifunctional Co4N nanoparticles with high activities for ORR and OER by a facile method has been rarely reported due to the insufficient study of the design and the synthesis reaction mechanisms.
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) with a moderate band gap has attracted much consideration due to its unique advantages, such as conductivity and chemical stability, and is widely used as a catalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction, photocatalytic, and hydrogen evolution reaction
[26]
,
[27]
,
[28]
. It is known that the bulk structure of g-C3N4 limits its application due to the small number s of active sites and high mass transfer resistance. The fabrication of g-C3N4-based heterostructured catalysts such as nanosheets, nanoparticles, nanofibers, and nanotubes is an effective strategy for further improvement of the catalytic performance of bulk g-C3N4
[29]
,
[30]
,
[31]
,
[32]
. Among different morphologies, one-dimensional (1D) carbon nitride nanotubes (CNNTs) have received more attention due to the efficient electron transfer along the 1D linear nanotube, whereas the exposure of the inner and outer surfaces can lead to the exposure of more active sites and promotes the reaction rate
[31]
,
[32]
. Recently, several investigations of CNNTs were reported, including the reports regarding their preparation and utilization. Wu et al. displayed a facile method for large-scale synthesis of g-C3N4 microtubes as the photocatalyst, suggesting the potential opportunities for the rational design of CNNTs
[32]
. First-principle calculations demonstrated that the high photocatalytic activity of CNNTs depends strongly on their diameter and indicate that the conductivity decreases with increasing CNNT diameter
[33]
. This may be the main reason why the CNNTs are rarely reported for use in ORR or OER catalysts.
Considering the above information, a distinctive structure of the Co4N nanoparticles embedded in the g-C3N4 nanotube was designed and synthesized by an in-situ method using urea as the nitrogen source and cobalt chloride as the precursor. After the thermal nitridation process, CNNT with a smooth surface showed the outer and inner diameter of 48 and 22 nm, respectively, and the highly dispersed Co4N nanoparticles are gathered at the top of CNNT as the active sites, enabling easy electron transfer along with the radial mode. The face-centered structure of Co4N and the degree of nitridation of g-C3N4 are both responsible for the obtained electrocatalytic performance, conductivity, and stability. In the ORR process, Co4N@CNNT showed superior activities with an onset potential of 0.94 V and half-wave potential of 0.86 V, displaying a positive shift relative to the standard Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, a lower Tafel slope and the yield of H2O2 were obtained due to the high reaction rate and much high content of the reduced state species on the surface. Interestingly, Co4N@CNNT also displays a remarkable OER performance, obtaining a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at 285 mV. A low Tafel slope value of 51 mV per decade for Co4N@CNNT is obtained that is much lower than that of IrO2 (69 mV per decade), suggesting outstanding OER kinetics, with a double-layer capacitance of 19.6 mF cm−2 due to the effective electrochemical surface area and high density of active sites. We believe that this novel and facile method has a positive effect on the design and synthesis of the distinct morphology of nitrides and conductive g-C3N4 structure, same as to obtaining the bifunctional electrocatalyst with high catalytic activity and robust stability, and to further expand the family of other transition metal materials and carbon materials.
All of the reagents used in these experiments were received from the Aladdin Company and were used without any further purification. The Co4N@CNNT samples were synthesized by a one-pot nitridation process. In detail, CoCl2 (0.1 g) is dissolved in alcohol (30 mL), and then urea (10 g) and H2O2 (2 mL) were added into the obtained pink solution and stirred for 60 h to obtain a blue solution. After adding NaCl (2 g), the solution was stirred for another 60 h to obtain a thick liquid, and then was transferred into an open oven at 60 °C for 12 h. After the reaction and pretreatment, the white powder was nitridated at the different temperatures of 650, 700, and 750 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting gray powder was leached by deionized water for 12 h to remove impurities. Finally, the obtained black powder was dried for 12 h in a vacuum oven at 60 °C and the obtained samples were named Co4N@CNNT-650, Co4N@CNNT-700, and Co4N@CNNT-750. A sample as a reference was prepared at 700 °C by the same experimental process except without NaCl.
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was conducted to confirm the purity of the catalysts with an automated Ultima IV, λ = 1.5418 Ǻ (Rigaku, Japan) X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Ka radiation with a scanning rate of 5° min−1 (2θ) from 10° to 70°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using an ESCALAB 250Xi (Thermo Fisher, USA) system to analyze the states of the elements at the surfaces of the samples. The morphology and microstructure of the samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN) at 200 kV and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM; ZEISS SUPRA® 55, Carl Zeiss), Spherical aberration-corrected electron microscope (HAADF-TEM, JEM ARM 200F). A thermal spectrometer using a laser with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm was used to record Raman spectra. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) was performed to determine the elemental ratio and distribution.
The catalytic activities were tested in a standard three-electrode system using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) and a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) setup from Pine Instrument Company connected to a CHI760E electrochemistry workstation. A glassy carbon disk (5 mm in diameter), an Ag/AgCl electrode with saturated KCl solution, and a graphite rod were used as the working electrode, the reference electrode, and the counter electrode respectively
[34]
. The catalyst ink was prepared as follows: the samples (5 mg), ultrapure water (0.1 mL), isopropanol (IPA, 0.8 mL) and Nafion solution (5 wt%, 0.1 mL) were ultrasonicated for more than 30 min to form a well-dispersed catalyst ink. Then catalyst ink (10 µl) was transferred to the surface of the GC electrode with the loading of 255 µg cm−2 and dried in an open oven for 15 min at 50 °C to obtain the working electrode. For comparison, a Pt/C ink was prepared by the same process with a loading amount of 127 µg cm−2 on the GC electrode. All the electrochemical performance measurements were referenced to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and recorded in an oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at room temperature.
The electron transfer mechanism in the ORR was analysed using the RRDE (disk 0.247 cm2 and ring 0.186 cm2) test at 1.322 V in a 0.1 M KOH solution. The electron number (n) and H2O2 yield (%) were calculated using equations

where ID and IR are the absolute values of the disk current and ring current, respectively. The collection efficiency constant is 37%.

where J is the measured current density (mV cm−2), JK is the kinetic-limiting current density, ω is the electrode rotation rate (rap/min), F is the Faraday constant (F = 96485 C cm−1), C0 is the bulk concentration of O2 (C0 = 1.2 × 10−3 mol L−1 in alkaline media), D0 is the diffusion coefficient of O2 (1.9 × 10−3 cm s−1 in 0.1 M KOH), andγis the kinetic viscosity of the electrolyte (0.01 cm2 s−1 in alkaline media).
For the OER test, the working electrode was prepared by the same process as that of ORR and was tested in 1 M KOH at room temperature. The Hg/HgO with 1 M KOH and graphite rod were used as the reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out from 1 Hz to 1000 kHz in alkaline media at the open-circuit voltage for ORR and at the potential of the current density of 10 mA cm−2 for OER. The chronoamperometric curve was used to confirm the electrochemical stability of the samples in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M or 1 M KOH solution at a rotation speed of 300 rpm at 35 °C.
The Co4N@CNNT samples were synthesized by the combination of a wetness-impregnation method and nitriding process (
Fig. 1
). In an alcohol solution, CoO is formed by the oxidation reaction and surrounded by urea to generate the intermediate CoO/Urea, because of that the abundant N anchor sites with lone electron pairs have the strong ability to adsorb atoms
[35]
,
[36]
. Interestingly, NaCl shows an important function in the reaction. In
Fig. S1
, the XRD and high resolution element mapping demonstrate that Co nanoparticles dominate in the samples with a poor ORR and OER performance, suggesting that the dispersant NaCl is to make the Co ions mixture well with urea to promote the nitridation process (
Fig. S1
). The g-C3N4 nanotube is synthesized by the catalysis of the Co2+ ions through the thermal polycondensation reaction, while, CoO is nitrided to Co4N by the excess of urea in the nitrogen atmosphere and is concentrated at the top of the g-C3N4 nanotube
[37]
. Eventually, Co4N@CNNT is obtained after removing impurities including NaCl and unreacted urea.
Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the synthesis process of Co4N@CNNT samples.
The crystal structures of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by XRD, with the results shown in
Fig. 2
a. The XRD patterns of the samples matched well the standard reference data for Co4N (PDF 04-021-6262) with three main peaks centered at 44.12°, 51.55°, and 76.11° belonging to the (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) crystal planes of cubic Co4N, indicating the successful synthesis of single-phase cobalt nitrides. And, the peaks strengthen with the temperature, due to the high temperature tend to form Co4N
[21]
,
[36]
. Moreover, Co4N shows a similar crystal structure and XRD pattern to Co metal except for a slight difference in d-spacing, because of that the N atoms were introduced into the lattice inducing a lattice distortion without crystal structure transformation, corresponding to the structure of interstitial compounds (
Fig. S2
)
[36]
. One broad and weak peak centered at 21° is observed that is attributed to the characteristic peak of an amorphous structure, with a sharp peak at 26.5° belonging to the (0 0 2) planes of g-C3N4, suggesting the successful synthesis of graphite phase carbon nitride. Compared with the pure g-C3N4, a 0.8° negative shift was observed for our samples, demonstrating that the in-situ synthesis process is associated with a larger lattice distortion due to the thermal treatment and the introduction of flux. The decreasing intensity of the characteristic peak of g-C3N4 suggests a collapsed structure resulting from the destroyed interplanar stacking with conjugated aromatic systems, corresponding to the increasing density of cobalt atoms.
Fig. 2. XRD patterns of Co4N@CNNT-650, Co4N@CNNT-700, and Co4N@CNNT-750 (a); Raman spectra of different samples (b).
In the inset of
Fig. 2
a, a peak at 44.24° (blue line) is too weak to be observed at low temperature but enhance with the increasing temperature, which is the characteristic peak of the Co metal suggesting that a higher temperature leads to the release of the N atoms from the interstitial Co4N to form cobalt
[21]
,
[38]
. Co4N@CNNT-650 and Co4N@CNNT-700 shows smaller particle sizes, confirmed by the larger half-widths of the peak than Co4N@CNNT-750. Co4N@CNNT-650 and Co4N@CNNT-700 shows a more exact agreement with the standard pattern of Co4N, while a 0.1° negative shift is clearly observed for Co4N@CNNT-750, indicating enlarged lattice spacing possibly due to the increasing Co atoms content. We believe that the differences between the structures of the three samples will result in different electrocatalytic activities of these samples in electrochemical reactions.
Fig. 2
b shows the Raman spectra that are used to obtain further insight into the crystalline structure and compositional features. A complicated pattern with seven clear peaks is observed, where the peaks centered at 516, and 668 cm−1 are due to the Co species, the peaks at 1346, 1576, and 2680 cm−1 correspond to the well-defined D, G, and 2D bands, and the peaks at 464 cm−1 is due to g-C3N4. Normally, the D band of graphite is attributed to the vibrations of sp3-bonded carbon atoms of local defects and disorder, while the G band of graphite results from the sp2 hybridization of carbon atoms in a hexagonal graphite ring [
39
]. The high degree of graphitization of g-C3N4 is beneficial for obtaining excellent conductivity, while the oxygen adsorption is promoted by high density of defects that is generally characterized by the ID/IG value. The ID/IG values of Co4N@CNNT-650 and Co4N@CNNT-750 are 0.9 and 0.92, exhibiting the excellent degree of graphitization mainly due to the increasing crystallinity of g-C3N4 in agreement with the obtained XRD patterns. Co4N@CNNT-700 with the ID/IG values of 0.98 shows the highest oxygen adsorption ability due to the high density of defects and the minute Co4N nanoparticles, while Co4N@CNNT-650 shows an insufficient nitriding process and Co4N@CNNT-750 displays a too high nitriding temperature leading to the collapsed structure, such as the releasing of nitrogen atom from g-C3N4 and/or Co4N. It should be noted that the peak centered at 186 cm−1 corresponds to the radial breathing mode that is sensitive to the diameter and electronic nature of the nanotubes
[40]
. The presence of a radial breathing mode indicates the nanotubes structure in our samples, since this Raman feature is unique to nanotubes and is not observed for other structures
[41]
,
[42]
.
XPS was used to further analyze the surface chemical properties of the samples, with the results shown in Figs. 3 and S3. In the slightly complicated patterns, several peaks are observed corresponding to the C, N, O, Co elements and their satellite peaks, demonstrating the presence of these elements in the samples (
Fig. S3
). In the C 1s spectrum (
Fig. 3
a), the peaks at 284.79, 284.45, and 288.92 eV were ascribed to the sp2 carbon from the C–C bonds of air carbon, sp3 carbon from the CN bonds, and sp3 carbon for the C-N bonds, confirming the formation of g-C3N4. Until now, the coating layer over Co4N nanoparticles is judged to be g-C3N4. The N1s spectra can be divided into five different types of peaks at 398.27, 399.06, 400.30, 401.42, and 403.51 eV
[14]
, that were unambiguously assigned to N-Co in Co4N, pyridinic N (N1), pyrrolic N (N2), graphitic N (N3), and the formation of N-O interactions at the interface between cobalt oxide and Co4N. Graphitic N contributes to improving the conductivity, while pyridinic N and pyrrolic N provide a high amount of removable electrons to decrease the charge transfer resistance. In the Co4N samples, the pyridinic N and pyrrolic N of sp2 hybridization account for most of the total nitrogen concentration due to the layer structure, suggesting that the atoms are sufficiently free to react with the transition metal atoms to improve oxygen reaction.
Fig. 3. XPS spectra of C 1s (a), Co 2p (b), N 1s (c), and O 1s (d) for Co4N@CNNT-650, Co4N@CNNT-700, and Co4N@CNNT-750 samples.
The Co 2p spectrum (
Fig. 3
b) exhibited Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 at the binding energies of 780.35 and 795.87 eV with the orbital splitting-energy of 15.52 eV, as reported in the literature
[43]
. The weak peaks centered at 779.72 and 794.86 eV are due to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 of Co-Co coordination, arising from the presence of the trace amount of single-phase Co metal
[21]
,
[22]
,
[44]
. Moreover, the intensity of the Co metal peak increases with the temperature, indicating the growing content of Co metal in the high temperature, in agreement with the XRD patterns. The peaks with the binding energies of 781.16 and 796.88 eV are ascribed to Co-N coordination, confirming the formation of Co4N after the nitridation process
[24]
,
[25]
. Compared with Co4N@CNNT-650, Co4N@CNNT-700 and Co4N@CNNT-750 show a positive shift of approximately 0.5 eV for the Co-N bonds due to the electron transfer between Co2+ and Co3+, suggesting that the Co4N may provide the active sites in the samples. The peak at 786.22 eV approximately 6 eV from the high energy component is a satellite peak that provides strong evidence for Co2+
[43]
. The intensity of this satellite peak becomes weak with the increasing temperature, suggesting the valence change evidenced by the peaks shift of the Co-N bonds which is beneficial for improving ORR performance. The peaks at 780.49 and 796.11 eV are attributed to Co-O bonds, as is verified by the presence of the Co-O peak at 529.75 eV in the O 1s spectra.
Fig. 3
d shows other two split peaks of the O 1s spectra at 531.39 and 533.31 eV corresponding to the O-O and O–H bonds respectively, which are due to the air, OH, and H2O adsorbed on the surface. Typically, the content of oxygen species from air or adsorption decreases with the increasing temperature due to the instability of these species.
SEM and TEM were conducted to examine the microstructure of the as-synthesized Co4N@CNNT-700.
Fig. 5
a displays a rough curve tube structure closed at both ends with the uniform diameters of approximately dozens of nanometers and lengths about several micrometers, suggesting the one-dimensional structure (
Fig. S4
). And, the roughness of the top of the curve stick is much higher than the tube wall, suggesting that Co4N nanoparticles are mainly embedded on the top of the g-C3N4 curve tube.
Fig. 4
,
Fig. 5
b-g, and S4-6 show the corresponding element mapping of Co4N samples and the bright-field images of the typical TEM. Co4N@CNNT-650 shows irregular 1D nanotubes with a rough surface and the gathered Co4N nanoparticles on the top of the nanotube because of the insufficient nitriding process (
Fig. 4
a and S6).
Fig. 4
c suggests the excessively high temperature leading to the unclear nanotube structure and Co4N particles covered by the thick g-C3N4 layers (
Fig. S7
). While, Co4N@CNNT-700 displays the smooth 1D nanotube structure with Co4N nanoparticles distributed on the top of the nanotube, suggesting the highly temperature-dependent (
Fig. 4
b and S5). The disordered nanotubes can be clearly observed with the diameters of less than 50 nm and the inner diameters of approximately 22 nm (
Fig. 4
b), confirming the presence of the g-C3N4 nanotubes enables easy electron transfer that enhances the electrocatalytic performance. HAADF-STEM images displayed that the Co4N nanoparticles (
Fig. 5
f and g) are distributed in the nanotube and showed the d-spacing of 0.21 nm and 0.18 nm (
Fig. 5
g) consistent with the theoretical values of the (1 1 1) and (0 0 2) facets of Co4N respectively, suggesting the distributed Co4N nanoparticles.
Fig. 4. Tube structure images of Co4N@CNNT-650 (a), Co4N@CNNT-700 (b) Co4N@CNNT-750 (c).
Fig. 5. SEM images of Co4N@CNNT-700 (a), EDS mapping images for C, O, N, and Co elements (b-e), the distribution of Co4N@CNNT-700 nanoparticles (f), and the HAADF-STEM images of Co4N@CNNT-700 (g).
The high resolution elemental mappings suggested that the N, C, O, and Co elements are homogeneously distributed over the nanotubes (
Fig. 5
b-e). The distribution of the C element is on the nanotube mainly coincides with that of the N element, suggesting that the nanotube is g-C3N4. Moreover, the N distribution on the top of the nanotube primarily is mostly the same as that of Co, suggesting the agglomeration of Co4N nanoparticles, in agreement with the SEM results. Based on the TEM and EDS results, we believe that Co4N@CNNT-700 are successfully synthesized and may exhibit high electrocatalytic performance.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the catalytic activities of the samples and was performed in an O2 saturated 0.1 M solution at a scan rate of 50 mV/s (
Fig. S8
). A severely irregular rectangular shape can be observed with three pronounced and strong oxygen peaks at 0.81, 0.84, and 0.78 V for Co4N@CNNT-650, Co4N@CNNT-700, and Co4N@CNNT-750 respectively, showing a potential for high ORR performance. Moreover, the weak H desorption peak at the low voltage suggests the presence of the oxide species such as CoO, in agreement with the above-discussed results
[15]
. Interestingly, the current sharply increases at the potential higher than the onset potential due to the strong oxygen adsorption, suggesting the possible application of this system in OER.
The polarization curves of the samples including the commercial Pt/C catalyst were measured in an oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution at a scan of 10 mV s−1 to determine the ORR activities (
Fig. 6
a). The highest onset potential is 0.94 V in the as-prepared samples which is slightly better than that of commercial Pt/C, suggesting the lower activation energy in the ORR process for Co4N@CNNT-700. Moreover, Co4N@CNNT-700 shows the highest half-wave potential 0.86 V that is even better than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.84 V), suggesting the excellent nature of oxygen electrocatalyst (Table S1). The highest reduction current density was measured with Co4N@CNNT-700, which is remarkably close to that measured for the Pt/C catalyst. Importantly, Co4N@CNNT-650 shows higher activity than Co4N@CNNT-750 as displayed by the onset potential, the half-wave potential, and the limited current; this may be due to the conductivity, the electronic structure, and the particle size of the highly distributed Co4N nanoparticles indicated by the Raman and XRD results. Normally, the high defect density, which is believed to have an important beneficial effect on the active sites, is beneficial for improving the catalytic ability due to the asymmetric charge density distribution
[45]
. These results demonstrate that Co4N@CNNT-700 displays a superior ORR performance compared to the other samples and comparable to that of commercial Pt/C.

To analyze the reaction mechanism of the catalyst, we conducted the RRDE test shown in

. The electrons transfer number is over 3.9 in the range from 0.2 to 0.8 V for Co4N@CNNT-650 and Co4N@CNNT-700, which is better than the commercial Pt/C catalyst, proving that the 4-electron process dominates during the reaction. The 4-electron pathway in the reaction is also verified by the Koutechy-Levich equation showing the values of 3.6–3.9 at 0.1–0.7 V, as displayed in
Figs. S10-12
. Correspondingly, the Co4N@CNNT samples show a lower H2O2 yield than Pt/C catalyst and the recently reported electrocatalysts
[21]

(

b). Usually, H2O2 is decomposed through reduction or oxidation, which relies on the surface state of the catalyst·H2O2 is reduced by adsorbing the initially produced OH groups on the reduced surface, whereas H2O2 is oxidized by reducing the oxidized surface which is a reversible reaction
[44]
. Clearly, the yield of H2O2 can be used to determine the surface oxidation or reduction state of the catalyst. Here, the extremely low H2O2 yield suggests that the reduced state dominates on the surface of our samples, suggesting an outstanding reaction rate and ORR performance

It is known that the Tafel slope can be used to infer which step is the rate limiting step in four electron pathway. Using calculations based on the LSV curves with the 1600r rotation speed, the Tafel slopes of Co4N@CNNT-650, Co4N@CNNT-700, Co4N@CNNT-750, and Pt/C are 87, 81, 84, and 88 mV per decade, respectively (
Fig. 6
c). The close values of the Tafel slope under the same conditions suggest the similar adsorption ability of oxygen and the reaction mechanism
[15]
,
[45]
. The lower Tafel slope can obtain a high current at low overpotential in the reaction and the rate-limiting chemical step follows the first electron transfer for our samples. Hence, the prepared catalysts show excellent ORR kinetics due to the effective Co4N active sites and high conductivity of g-C3N4 nanotube.
Fig. 6
d shows the kinetic current densities for samples including the commercial Pt/C catalyst that are calculated from the intercepts of the Koutechy-Levich plots. Knowing that the potential ranges of 0.8 V to 0.9 V vs. RHE appeared as high potential, the kinetic current densities are still the most important feature of an ORR catalyst at a given potential and in the absence of mass transfer limitations
[46]
. Co4N@CNNT-700 shows surprisingly kinetic current density over the samples, which is better than that of the Pt/C catalyst, suggesting its superior activities.
As the most active catalysts, the stability of the samples was examined by the chronoamperometric response (
Fig. 6
e,
Fig. S13
). 96% of the original current density is maintained for Co4N@CNNT-700 electrode after 50000 s whereas the commercial Pt/C catalyst exhibits a much higher current loss of 29%, same higher than the other two samples (9% for Co4N@CNNT-650 and 11% for Co4N@CNNT-750).
Fig. S13
shows the morphology of Co4N@CNNT-700 catalyst after the reaction, the nanotube structure and Co4N nanoparticles are kept with a slight deformation, suggesting the high stability during the reaction process. Thus, the comparison of these results demonstrates the superior stability of the samples compared to the standard Pt/C catalyst.
EIS spectra and the corresponding circuit are shown in
Fig. 6
f, and are used to evaluate the electron transfer resistance. The electron transfer resistance values are 33.9, 29.5, and 38.3 O for Co4N@CNNT-650, Co4N@CNNT-700, and Co4N@CNNT-750 respectively, consistent with the defect density-dependent trend. Since it displays the highest ORR performance, Co4N@CNNT-700 shows the lowest resistance because the radial conductive mode promotes electron transfer, and the lower resistance enables electron transfer to facilitate the ORR process. The higher resistance values of Co4N@CNNT-650 and Co4N@CNNT-750 are mainly due to the incomplete nitriding process or too high thermal treatment temperature, in agreement with the Raman and XRD results. The EIS results confirm the remarkable improvement of Co4N@CNNT-700 in electrochemical reactions due to the low electron transfer resistance.
Excitingly, besides the excellent ORR performance, our composites also exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance in OER. It is known that Pt/C is not a suitable OER catalyst due to the much higher overpotential required to obtain the current density of 10 mA cm−2. Co4N@CNNT-700 shows the lowest onset potential and highest anodic current density in all of the samples that are even better than those obtained by the standard IrO2 catalyst, indicating the excellent OER performance of these composites. As shown in
Fig. 7
a, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2, Co4N@CNNT-700 only requires 285 mV, which is much lower than the values for Co4N@CNNT-650 (353 mV), Co4N@CNNT-750 (360 mV), and the reference catalyst IrO2 (340 mV). It is believed that the carbon nanotube structure and the introduction of the highly dispersed Co4N nanoparticles results in the radial conductive mode that cannot facilitate the adsorption of oxide species, but also promotes electron transfer. Significantly, the potential obtained for the current density of 10 mA cm−2 is comparable to those of the other reported nitrides OER catalysts (Table S2)
[46]
.

The Tafel plots are shown in
Fig. 7
b, which is used to explain the electron transfer rate at low overpotential. The measured value for IrO2 was 69 mV per decade, in agreement with the reported values
[22]
,
[24]
. The Tafel slopes for Co4N@CNNT-650, Co4N@CNNT-750, and Pt/C were 75, 87, and 150 mV per decade, respectively. By contrast, Co4N@CNNT-700 showed a much lower Tafel slope of 51 mV per decade, which is better than that of the reference IrO2 catalyst, suggesting its more favorable OER kinetics.
Even though Co4N@CNNT-700 has been demonstrated to be an outstanding conductor for electron transfer in the ORR environment, this may not be sufficient for a real OER in a 1 M KOH solution due to the different reaction environment.
Fig. 7
c compares the Nyquist plots for the Co4N samples at a constant potential of 1.5 V. Among all of the samples, Co4N@CNNT-700 had the fastest reaction kinetics with the smallest electron transfer resistance (8.7 Ohm) during the OER process, due to the excellent coupling effect between the carbon nanotube and the Co4N nanoparticles that enable easy electron transfer from the active sites to the surface. Co4N@CNNT-650 showed a much lower resistance than Co4N@CNNT-750, suggesting that high temperature can greatly damage the structure of g-C3N4 to decrease electrical conductivity. Moreover, the corresponding circuit was also simulated via the Z-view software, as shown inset of
Fig. 7
c. The calculated electron transfer resistance shows the same trend as the OER activity and the density of the structural defects, demonstrating that the conductivity of nanotube is temperature-dependent.
Therefore, the superior electrocatalyst activity for OER of Co4N@CNNT-700 is confirmed as indicated by the low onset overpotential, high current density, and the corresponding low Tafel slope value. To further reveal the origin of the efficient OER performance and to compare the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of Co4N@CNNT-700, the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of the electrodes was conducted (Inset of
Fig. 7
d and
Figs. S14-16
). Co4N@CNNT-700 with a Cdl of 19.6 mF cm−2 that is six times greater than the value for Co4N@CNNT-750 (3.3 mF cm−2) and 1.5 times greater than the value for Co4N@CNNT-650 (11.5 mF cm−2), indicating the higher ECSA and density of active sites.
The stability of the electrocatalyst is a key factor for large-scale applications. The chronoamperometry measurements for electrocatalysts including the standard IrO2 catalyst were conducted in the 1 M solution at the potential of the current density of 10 mA cm−2 to explore the electrocatalyst stability (
Fig. 7
d). After continuous operation for 36000 s, Co4N@CNNT-700 shows no significant depletion in the current density, further displaying the favorable stability due to the coupling effect between the g-C3N4 nanotube and the Co4N nanoparticles
[47]
. Noticeably, the current of Co4N@CNNT-750 declines sharply in the first 5000 s and then shows no further any decrease mainly due to the dissolution or detachment of the cobalt atoms
[48]
. All of the above results indicate that Co4N@CNNT-700 can serve as a highly effective OER electrocatalyst.
Typically, investigations of Co-based OER electrocatalyst have reported a possible mechanism. In our catalysts, the Co atoms in the surface of Co4N nanoparticles are oxidized to form CoOOH@Co4N composites as the active sites to promote the formation of O2 by OH–
[49]
. In this case, the high density of the nitrogen atoms and the coupling effect change the electronic environment to enhance the intrinsic metallic characteristics of Co4N, and the six-fold cavities of g-C3N4 can easily adsorb OH–; both of these effects are responsible for overcoming the kinetically sluggish OER process to improve the OER performance.
In conclusion, a novel synthesis strategy was developed to obtain highly dispersed Co4N nanoparticles embedded in the g-C3N4 nanotubes as the OER and ORR bifunctional electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the high density of defects and the coupling effect between the nanoparticles and the nanotubes, Co4N@CNNT-700 showed exciting ORR and OER performance characteristics. The onset potential and half-wave potential of Co4N@CNNT-700 are higher than those of the reference catalyst of the ORR process, and the Tafel slope, the yield of H2O2, and electron transfer resistance are superior to those of the other catalysts including the Pt/C catalyst. The four-electron transfer pathway is confirmed by the RRDE measurements and the K-L equation. Simultaneously, Co4N@CNNT-700 showed a surprising overpotential of 285 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 that had a negative shift of 55 mV compared to the reference IrO2 catalyst. Benefitting from the radial electronic conduction mode and high double-layer capacitance, the catalyst showed a much lower value of the Tafel slope and EIS than the other samples. This novel, in-situ, and facile synthesis method shows a strong improvement for the development of cost-effective and efficient ORR and OER catalyst.
