Gas phase CO2 electrolysis can maximize the CO2 reduction efficiency to ∼100%.
Nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) with high concentration of pyridinic N sites (62.3% of all nitrogen) were prepared by pyrolysis of phenathroline heterocycle precursor, and they can reduce CO2 to CO with high selectivity and stability. Faradaic efficiency of CO maintained >94.5% between −0.6 to −0.9 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and the CO current density was as high as 20.2 mA cm−2. Moreover, during 40 h electrolysis at −0.8 V, Faradic efficiency for CO was stable at 95%. The high performance came from rich concentrations of pyridine N sites in NCNTs, serving as the active sites for catalysis. Furthermore, gas phase CO2 electrolysis showed nearly 100% Faradic efficiency for CO, suggesting that the NCNT can maximize the CO2 reduction efficiency and hydrogen evolution was suppressed completely.
Carbon nanotubes with high pyridinic nitrogen content exhibited high efficiency and selectivity for CO2 reduction reaction. They were used in gas phase CO2 electrolysis and achieved nearly 100% efficiency for CO.

As climate change becomes more prominent [

], many solutions have been developed for reduction of CO2, such as electrochemical, photochemical and biological methods [

,

]. Despite many challenges, electrochemical reduction is promising for conversion of CO2 to fuels and chemicals with renewable energy [
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
,
[9]
,
[10]
]. However, CO2 is very stable, and electrocatalytic reduction often suffers from high over-potential, slow kinetics, low product selectivity and catalyst stability [
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
]. Noble metal electrodes exhibit high selectivity and stability for reduction of CO2 at relatively low over-potential [
[14]
,
[15]
,
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
]. In addition, catalysts based on inexpensive materials are recently being explored such as Sn [

[20]

[21]
], Cu [

[30]
], etc.
Nitrogen-doped carbon materials are efficient catalysts for CO2 electroreduction [
9
,
13
,
31
]. Nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber exhibited small overpotential for CO2 reduction in ionic liquids [
28
]. N-doped graphene quantum dot produced multi-carbon products such as ethanol, acetate and n-propanol, although the product selectivity of each was relatively low [
29
]. Recently, nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon was used to reduce CO2 to ethanol with high efficiency and selectivity (77%) in aqueous media [
30
]. Other N-doped materials, such as N-doped graphene [
[32]
,
[33]
,
[34]
], diamond and carbon [
35
,
36
] have also been reported for CO2 reduction reaction (Table S1).
Among N-doped carbons, N-doped carbon nanotubes gained much attention for CO2 reduction and other electrocatalysis [
37
], because of unique electronic and geometric features [
38
]. Polyethylenimine-modified NCNTs can reduce CO2 to formate with high selectivity (87%) and current density in aqueous media [
39
]. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) prepared NCNT arrays showed high selectivity of 80% for CO at a low overpotential of 0.26 V [
40
]. The superior activity for this NCNT array was attributed to high density of pyridinic N sites (27% of all Ns) [
41
]. NCNTs catalysts synthesized by the calcination of polymers can achieve a maximum current efficiency of 90% for CO formation at a potential of −0.9 V vs RHE with pyridinic N content of 32% [
42
]. However, those NCNTs catalysts also suffer from low CO current density compared with noble-metal catalysts. Increasing the N concentration is critical for more efficient catalysts.
Among those nitrogen-doped carbon materials, pyridinic N is regarded as the most important catalytic site for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Graphitic N defects are less capable for CO2 binding, and pyrrolic N defects have little or no impact on the CO2RR activity. However, the atomic abundance of the pyridinic N in most catalysts was low, mostly ca 30% of all N atoms, and only a few materials can reach ca 60% pyridinic N (Table S1). Therefore, increasing the density of pyridinic N defects is critical. Pyrolysis is an effective method to prepare NCNTs with high N content [
[33]
,
[34]
,
[35]
]. Herein, phenathroline was used as precursor to increase the pyridine N concentration. The influence of N doping and atomic configurations on activity was investigated and catalytic active sites were identified. In addition, the mechanism of CO2RR on NCNTs was proposed.
To further maximize the CO2 reduction efficiency, gas phase CO2 electrolysis was performed. As water can compete with the adsorption of CO2 on N sites in aqueous phase [
34
,
36
], gas phase CO2 electrolysis is a promising approach to maximize the CO2 reduction efficiency with accelerated mass transfer and increased surface adsorption of CO2 [
[43]
,
[44]
,
[45]
,
[46]
]. Pyridinic N sites with high basicity could concentrate CO2 on surface which is favorable to subsequent CO2RR [
39
]. Reaction of CO2 at solid − gas interface not only overcomes the low solubility limitations in aqueous phase, but also increases CO2 adsorption at the active sites [
47
]. The pyridinic N rich NCNT with surface CO2 enrichment can be synergetic with gas phase electrolysis to increase the catalytic activity.
NaHCO3 (99.5%), ethanol (99.7%) and nitric acid were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. 1,10-Phenanthroline monohydrate was purchased from Jiuding Chemistry. Multi-walled carbon nanotube was purchased from XFNano Company. Ar (99.999%), and CO2 (99.999%) were purchased from the Beijing Qianxi Gas Company. NH3 (99.999%) was purchased from Beijing Chengxinshunxing Gas Company. Nafion® 117 membrane was purchased from DuPont. Electrolyte solutions were prepared with DI water.
In the preparation of NCNT-NH3, 600 mg of 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate was dissolved in a mixture of 25 ml of ethanol and 25 ml of deionized water. Then, 200 mg of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) (nitric acid was applied first to remove metal ions) was added and stirred for 12 h at room temperature. The dispersions was heated to evaporate the solvent and dried in an oven at 105 °C for 12 h. Then, grinding the mixture into a powder in an agate mortar yielded precursor of NCNT. Finally, the NCNT-NH3-700 (or NCNT-NH3 for short) and NCNT-Ar were prepared by the calcination of precursor under NH3 and Ar atmosphere (100 sccm) at 700 °C for 3 h, respectively. The temperature in the calcination was controlled by the temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 and a cooling rate of 3.3 °C min−1. The precursor of NCNT was also calcined at 300 °C and 500 °C for 3 h under NH3 to obtain NCNT-NH3-300 and NCNT-NH3-500, respectively. The CNT-NH3 and CNT-Ar were prepared by calcination of the original MWCNT at 700 °C for 3 h under NH3 and Ar atmosphere, respectively. The catalysts were listed in
Table 1
.
Table 1. Brief summary for the preparation of catalysts.
The morphology of NCNTs catalysts were characterized by JEOL JEM-2100 F transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; S-4800, Hitachi). X-ray diffraction analyses (XRD) were collected on a Bruker DAVINCI D8 ADVANCE diffractometer using a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.54184 nm). X-ray diffraction spectra were obtained for 2 θ values differing from 10 to 90 degrees with a step length of 0.1 °. Raman spectra were recorded from 200 to 3200 cm−1 on an inVia-Reflex confocal laser micro-Raman spectrometer with a CCD detector using Ar+ laser excitation with a wavelength of 532 nm at 10 mW laser power. The microscope was with a 50x telephoto lens. An ESCALAB 250 XI X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of Thermo Scientific was used to analyze the surface electronic structures, using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). A survey scan was performed with a step size of 1 eV, a pass energy of 80 eV, and a dwell time of 200 ms. High resolution scans were then taken for each element present with a step size of 0.1 eV and a pass energy of 20 eV. The binding energy for all peaks was referenced to the C 1 s peak at 284.6 eV. The software of XPSPEAK41 was used for the interpretation/deconvolution of spectra. The peak fitting parameters for XPS were summarized in Table S4 (supporting information). CO2 adsorption-desorption isotherm was measured on a Quantachrome Autosorb-1-C-TCD instrument.
Electrochemical measurements were performed with a CHI660E electrochemistry workstation in an H-cell (separated by Nafion) with a conventional three-electrode system using 0.5 M aqueous electrolyte at room temperature. The Pt wire and saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The measured potentials after iR compensation were rescaled to the RHE by E (vs. RHE)  = E (vs. SCE) + 0.245 V + 0.0591 V × pH. The working electrode was prepared as following: 10 mg catalysts and 100 μL of 5 wt % Nafion solution were dispersed in 1 mL ethanol with sonication for 1 h to form a homogeneous ink. 10 μL of the ink was load onto a 3 mm diameter glassy carbon electrode and dried at room temperature before electrochemical tests.
Before the controlled potential electrolysis (CPE), CO2 (99.999%) was purged into over 30 min to remove the air from electrolyte, then the electrolysis was conducted under sealed conditions. The gaseous products were analyzed by SRI MG-I GC with a helium ionization detector (HID) and had been calibrated using external gas standard. Liquid products were analyzed by solution NMR (Bruker AVNANCE-400) using N, N-dimethylformamide as an internal standard.
The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of catalysts was calculated from their electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were performed to obtain Cdl. The potential of CV was ranged from 0.37 to 0.47 V vs RHE with various scan rates (10, 20, 30, 50, 80 and 100 mV s−1) under CO2 atmosphere. The Cdl was calculated by plotting the Δj = ja − jc at 0.42 V vs the scan rate, in which jc and ja are the cathodic and anodic current densities, respectively. The linear slope was twice that of Cdl. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed in the frequency range of 0.1 to 100,000 Hz with an amplitude of 10 mV at the potential of −0.6 V vs RHE.
The membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) contained anion-exchange membrane (TWEDAI, TianWei Membrane, Inc., China) and anodic and cathodic catalyst layers. Cathode ink was obtained by mixing 25 mg NCNT-NH3-700 with 5 mL n-propyl alcohol and 0.1 mL 5 wt. % anion-exchange resin solution (TWEDAI, TianWei Membrane, Inc., China). The cathode ink was sonicated for 15 min and sprayed onto an anion-exchange membrane of 5 cm2 active area, and then cold-pressed at 0.6 MPa for 5 min. The anode ink was made of 25 mg iridium black (HeSen, Shanghai, China) with 5 mL n-propyl alcohol and 0.1 mL 5 wt% Nafion solution (DuPont, USA), the mixture was sonicated for 5 min. The anode ink was sprayed onto the above anion-exchange membrane with a 5 cm2 active area, and then was cold-pressed at 0.6 MPa for 5 min.
Electrochemical flow cell was assembled using 5 cm2 fuel cell hardware with graphite serpentine flow channels, by sandwiching the MEA with gaskets for sealing and electrical insulation. Titanium mesh was used as the current collector. In the electrolysis, DI water was fed to the anode with the flow rate of 33 sccm by peristaltic pump (BT100 M, EasyPump, Inc., BaoDing, China), and the CO2 stream was humidified at room temperature and fed to the cathode at the flow rate of 30 sccm by using mass flow controller (D07, Sevenstar, Beijing, China). The content of water vapor in CO2 was determined by a hygrometer (DWS-T5, DiHui, Beijing, China). Electrochemical study was performed on CHI 1140C electrochemical station (CHI Instruments, Inc.) in a two electrode electrochemical system with an additional reference electrode for measuring potential only. The gaseous product was analyzed by SRI gas analyzer GC equipped with a Helium Ionization detector (HID, SRI 8610C, USA). The GC used a helium carrier gas and was calibrated using external gas standard.
Heterocycle 1,10-phenanthroline was used as the main N source to prepare NCNT-NH3 and NCNT-Ar by pyrolysis under ammonia and Ar respectively (
Fig. 1
a,
Table 1
). Hypothetical pyrolysis mechanism for 1,10-phenanthroline was proposed in
Fig. 1
b, which could provide rich and well defined pyridinic nitrogen atoms on surface.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of NCNT-NH3 showed nanoporous structure (
Figs. 2
a & S1). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image (
Fig. 2
b) showed structures of the multi-walled carbon nanotube, and the deposited carbon materials could not be resolved. The electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) mapping of NCNT-NH3-700 in
Fig. 2
b revealed that the N and O atoms distributed homogeneously on NCNT-NH3. X-ray diffraction (XRD) (
Fig. 2
c) showed three diffraction peaks, at 2θ = 27.3°, 43° and 53°, and they were assigned to the (002), (100) and (004) planes, respectively [
40
]. The Raman spectrum in
Fig. 2
d showed a D- and G-band at ca. 1345 cm−1 and 1575 cm−1, respectively. The ratio of D- and G-band (ID/IG) increased from 0.704 to 0.744 after pyrolysis under NH3, which indicates that more defects were created in NCNT-NH3 catalysts.

Fig. 3. XPS characterization. (a)–(c) XPS of N 1s spectra for NCNT-NH3, NCNT-Ar and CNT-NH3, respectively, and (d) nitrogen atomic content.
XPS was used to investigate the amount of N doping and atomic configurations. For the N 1 s spectra of phenanthroline precursor on CNT, pyridinic N atom was fit at ca. 399.0 eV (Fig. S3). The XPS analysis showed that the total N contents of the NCNT-NH3, NCNT-Ar were comparable, at 2.51% and 2.54%, respectively (
Figs. 3
d & S4). The high-resolution N 1 s spectra of NCNT-NH3 and NCNT-Ar (
Fig. 3
a & b) were deconvoluted into three sub-peaks at ca. 399.0, 400.4 and 401.2 eV, assigned to pyridinic, pyrrolic and graphitic N, respectively. The pyridinic N and pyrrolic N were the dominant N sites in these materials. The percentage of pyridinic N atoms was 62.3% for NCNT-NH3 and 53.3% for NCNT-Ar of all N atoms. Thus, pyridinic N atoms occupied higher atomic ratio in NCNT-NH3 compared to previous reports (Table S1), due to using both the organic precursor and ammonia treatment. As for CNT-NH3, the pyridinic N was at very low content of 0.26 at. % (
Fig. 3
c & d). And as expected, no N atoms of any type were found in CNT-Ar.
The electrochemical CO2 reduction was examined by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in CO2 (
Fig. 4
a) and Ar (Fig. S5a) saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution. Current densities of NCNT-NH3 and NCNT-Ar increased sharply at −0.48 V vs RHE and a reduction wave appeared at peak potential of −0.70 V vs RHE under CO2. However, no reduction wave was found under Ar. The peak current at −0.70 V increased linearly with increasing concentrations of NaHCO3 electrolyte (Fig. S6a, b). A plot of log(J) vs log([HCO3–]) shows a slope of 0.116, suggesting that the reduction wave was independent on HCO3– and was due to surface adsorbed species [
48
]. Also, for CNT-NH3, the reduction peak became smaller, and for CNT-Ar, no reduction peak was found under CO2. Based on the above results, the reduction peak can be assigned as reduction of surface adsorbed CO2. Those results indicate that N doping is beneficial for CO2 reduction reaction.

Controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) was performed to evaluate the product of CO2 reduction. The applied potentials were varied from −0.4 to −1.2 V vs RHE in CO2 saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution. CO and H2 were the only gaseous products and no solution product was detected. NCNT-NH3 showed the highest activity for CO2 reduction reaction (
Fig. 4
b, c). The onset of electrocatalysis occurred at −0.4 V with CO FE of 62.1%, corresponding to a low overpotential of 0.3 V. The CO current density increased with the applied potential, reaching 22.3 mA cm−2 at −1.0 V, and the FE of CO was above 94.5% within the range of −0.6 to −0.9 V. The maximum CO FE reached 96.2% with a decent CO current density of 9.7 mA cm−2 at −0.7 V. The CO FE of NCNT-Ar was slightly smaller compared to NCNT-NH3 between −0.6 to −0.9 V (
Fig. 4
c). With more negative applied potential, the rate of hydrogen evolution reaction increased, resulting in decrease of CO FE. By contrast, the CO FE became much smaller in CNT-Ar and CNT-NH3. The maximum CO FE was 58.8% for CNT-NH3 at −0.7 V. CNT-Ar mainly produced H2 and the maximum FE for CO was only 5.1% at −0.8 V. Control experiments were performed using NCNT-NH3 in Ar saturated 0.5 M NaHCO3 and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions. The FE of H2 exceeds 95% (Fig. S7), indicating that CO arises from CO2, not from the functional groups on the surface of NCNTs.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed at −0.6 V and the EIS plots were fit with an equivalent electronic circuit (
Fig. 5
). Rs, Rct, CPE and Zw denote electrolyte solution resistance, charge-transfer impedance, constant phase element and Warburg impedance, respectively. The Rct of NCNT-NH3 and NCNT-Ar were fit as 54 and 62 Ω, respectively, much lower than the value of 174 Ω for CNT-NH3 and 197 Ω for CNT-Ar. The lower Rct indicates that the electron transfer in NCNT-NH3 is more rapid than others.
Fig. 5. The Nyquist plots at −0.6 V and equivalent circuit for the catalysts.
NCNT-NH3 samples were synthesized at different pyrolysis temperatures. The contents and states of nitrogen in prepared catalysts were shown in
Fig. 6
. XPS showed that N content increase from at 0.98% to 2.51% with increasing pyrolysis temperature from 300 to 700 °C. NCNT-NH3-700 ranks the highest in the absolute pyridinic N content at 1.56%, followed by 1.20% in NCNT-NH3-500 and 0.78% in NCNT-NH3-300. Interestingly, high pyridinic N percentage of 79.6% can be obtained at low pyrolysis temperature of 300 °C. Low pyrolysis temperature can increase the pyridinic N percentage; however, the absolute pyridinic N content could be improved at higher temperature. CPE results in Fig. S8 showed that all catalysts were highly selective for CO. The maximum CO FE of 98.6% was achieved at NCNT-NH3-300, which may be contributed by its high pyridinic N percentage. From the results of CPE, high pyridinic N percentage is helpful to increase the FE of CO. In addition, the CO current density increased linearly with content of the pyridinic N at the same applied potential (
Fig. 7
a), suggesting that the pyridinic N is the main active site for CO2RR.

CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) results (Fig. S9) showed a broad CO2 desorption peak at 110 °C on NCNT-NH3, assigned to weak chemical adsorption on the catalyst surface. However, only a small peak was found on CNT-NH3 and CNT-Ar, and the desorption temperature was lower. The high desorption temperature indicates relatively strong adsorption between CO2 and catalyst, which can benefit CO2RR [
36
]. Those data indicate that the adsorption behavior of CO2 was mostly contributed by N sites on NCNT surface.
The electrochemical surface area (ECSA) in NCNT catalysts increased upon N doping. From data in Fig. S10, the ECSA of NCNT-NH3 is nearly the same as NCNT-Ar, but two and four times higher than CNT-NH3 and CNT-Ar, respectively. Higher ECSA suggests more catalytically active sites and could lead to the enhanced activity of NCNT catalysts.
NCNT-NH3 showed high catalytic stability for CO2 reduction. In CPE for 40 h at −0.8 V (
Fig. 7
b), the CO FE maintained at 95%. XPS was used to investigate the configuration of nitrogen after long-term electrolysis (Fig. S11). In
Fig. 7
c, after 5 h CPE for CO2RR, the relative concentration of pyrrolic N at 400.1 eV exhibited an obviously increase from 20.9% to 59.5%, and pyridinic N decreased from 62.3% to 40.5%. According to previous reports [
28
,
29
,
49
,
50
], this result suggests a weak interaction between pyridinic N and CO2, which shares a similar binding energy with pyrrolic N. In the long-term CPE, the relative concentration of pyridinic N remained a relatively stable value, from 40.5% to 46.1%. Nanoporous structure kept intact in the SEM images of NCNT-NH3 after 40 h electrolysis (Fig. S12). Compared with previous reports in Table S1, NCNT-NH3 exhibited higher activity for CO2 reduction, including high selectivity, current density and long-term stability.
Gas phase CO2 electrolyses were performed in a flow cell with a membrane-electrode assembly (MEA), and the NCNT-NH3 was loaded at the cathode side (Fig. S13). LSV curve in
Fig. 8
a showed significant current density increasing from the cell voltage of 2 V, and the CO2 reduction peak can be observed at 2.7 V. In the constant voltage electrolysis, the FE and current density of CO were shown in
Figs. 8
b & S14a, and only CO can be detected at cell voltage of 3.0 and 3.2 V. This result indicates that hydrogen evolution was almost completely suppressed. The current density of CO increased from 16.8 to 28.8 mA cm−2 as cell voltage from 2.6 to 3.2 V (cathode potentials measured to be −0.62 to −0.76 V vs NHE). Moreover, the CO FE kept nearly 100% and the CO current density was stable at 26 mA cm−2 in 17 h electrolysis (Fig. S14b). The amount of CO product reached 0.0414 mol. The CO rates and CO2 conversion values for the gas-phase electrolysis were listed in Table S2. In addition, the catalytic stability was further improved in gas phase CO2 electrolysis. These results suggest that gas phase CO2 electrolysis is a viable approach to maximize the CO2 reduction efficiency, selectivity as well as the catalyst stability.

(b) FE of CO (blue) and H2 (red) vs cell voltage (left axis) and partial current density of CO vs cell voltage (right axis), values above the column are cathode potentials vs normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).
Tafel analysis was performed to understand the kinetics of CO2 reduction (
Fig. 9
a). Tafel slopes were 92 and 100 mV dec−1 for NCNT-NH3 and NCNT-Ar, which are relatively small compared to literature reports. Both are less than 118 mV dec−1, indicating faster kinetics for CO formation. According to previous works, the two-electron reduction of CO2 to CO on NCNTs may follow the following steps [
17
,
48
]
(1)
CO2 + * → *CO2
(2)
*CO2 + e− → *CO2−
(3)
*CO2− + 2H+ + e− → *CO + H2O
(4)
*CO → CO + *
where the asterisk denotes an active site. As proposed in Fig. 9b, first, CO2 is adsorbed on the active site, and then accepts one electron to form a surface bound CO2•−. In subsequent steps, the CO2 − intermediate takes two protons and another electron to form *CO and H2O [
17
]. Finally, CO is released from active site. However, with strong CO2 adsorption, electron transfer (eq 2) becomes the rate-determining step (RDS) and the Tafel slopes are less than 118 mV dec−1. The small Tafel slope suggests the benefits of high pyridinic N concentration. According to DFT calculations [
30
,
36
,
41
], the CO binding on NCNT surface is very weak and CO can be de-adsorbed quickly, and it is difficult for *CO to take a proton to complete further reduction process.
Fig. 9. (a) Tafel plots for CO formation. (b) Proposed mechanism for the CO2 reduction reaction on NCNTs.
The increased catalyst efficiency is attributed to high pyridinic N content in NCNT-NH3. It is consistent with previous reports by Ajayan et al. [
41
], the energy barrier for pyridinic N in CO2 reduction is lower than pyrrolic N. From XPS analyses, three types of N exist in carbon nanotubes. The pyridinic N and pyrrolic N are located in a π conjugated system [
38
]. The pyridinic N in a six-membered ring contributes one p electron to the π system, whereas the pyrrolic N in a five-membered ring contributes two p electrons [
38
,
51
,
52
]. The graphitic N corresponds to the N species which substitutes for C atoms on the graphite layers [
31
]. Pyridinic N is a more basic site and easily adsorbs the CO2 molecule [
53
], which benefits the subsequent CO2RR. Using the phenathroline as precursor, the concentration of pyridinic N is significantly increased contributing to more efficient CO2RR [
29
,
30
,
33
,
34
,
36
,
[39]
,
[40]

[41]
].
In summary, NCNTs with high atomic abundances of pyridinic N for CO2RR were synthesized. NCNT-NH3 exhibited outstanding CO2 reduction performance, and the maximum Faradaic efficiency and current density for CO production reached 96.5% and 22 mA cm−2, respectively. The remarkable performance is due to high concentration of pyridinic N defects. Furthermore, Tafel relation indicates fast kinetics for CO formation at NCNTs. Gas phase electrolysis increases CO2-catalyst interactions and further improves selectivity and stability. It provides a more efficient process to convert and utilize CO2 and could be applicable to more types of carbon and metal catalysts.
