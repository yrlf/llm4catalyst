Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have proved to be efficient and sustainable energy conversion systems that can convert chemical energy directly into electricity. (1−7) Due to the high ionic conductivity and commercial availability of proton-conducting membranes, PEMFC operated under acidic conditions have a brighter prospect in practical industrialization compared to alkaline membrane fuel cells. (8−10) The technical limitations related to the PEMFC, especially the low reaction kinetics of the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic solution, have been proven to be a complex bottleneck in its implementation. (11−15) Although excellent ORR performance has already been achieved by Pt-based catalysts, the scarcity, prohibitive cost, and low tolerance to methanol crossover hinder their large-scale commercialization. (16−24) In this regard, exploiting earth-abundant and non-precious-metal catalysts (NPMCs) is still indispensable. (25−35) Over the past decades, nitrogen-coordinated transition-metal configurations that are incorporated into a carbon substrate (TM–N–C) have arisen as new types of potential catalysts for the ORR, due to their excellent electrical conductivity, high activity, and good corrosion resistance. (36−42) Among them, the Fe–N–C catalysts have demonstrated an outstanding ORR catalytic performance which is even comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution. (43−46) However, in acidic solution, the catalytic activity of Fe–N–C is still unsatisfactory due to the adsorption behavior of the intermediates during the ORR at the Fe–N4 catalytic active centers being too strong; thus, the reaction kinetics is still dragged down by the O–O bond scission and desorption step. (47,48) To cope with this issue, elaborate regulation of the active moiety toward a rationally designed geometric structure and energy level is in hot pursuit yet still lies ahead as a challenge. Configurations with bimetal or polymetal sites have emerged as exciting alternatives to enhance the catalytic efficiency. (49−55) On account of the inherent structural features of Fe–N–C, oxygen molecules tend to adsorb on the single Fe atom site through an end-on or side-on model, which would lead to high energy barriers of O–O bond scission, thereby rendering the following enhancement of catalytic activity painstaking. (56−58) Meanwhile, dual-metal atom site catalysts with mediated synergistic effects show great promise in accelerating ORR kinetics. The ORR intermediates prefer to adsorb via a bridge-cis adsorption model onto the dual metal sites, which is favorable for the O–O bond rupture and beneficial to the 4e– ORR pathway, thus enabling an improvement in catalytic performance. (48,59,60)
The d-band model proposed by Norskov and Hammer has been applied broadly in correlating the adsorption properties of rate-controlling intermediates with the electronic structure of catalytic materials. (61,62) The adsorption affinity of ORR intermediates are dominated by the d-orbital center of the transition metal TM in the TM–N–C electrocatalysts. (63,64) A lower d-orbital center suggests fewer occupied antibonding states of oxygen species and a weaker bonding strength between the Fe–N4 site and ORR intermediates. (65,66) Accordingly, this calls for further modulation of the electronic structure of the d-orbital center of Fe toward a better location and thus optimizes the absorption–desorption behavior of ORR intermediates.
A recent report showed that a pyrolyzed Cr–N–C electrocatalyst with a planar Cr–N4 coordination configuration exhibited outstanding activity for the ORR in acidic electrolyte. (67) As Mo is a congener of Cr, this finding suggests the possibility of an Mo–N4 configuration being a cocatalytic site for the Fe–N4C catalyst in acid ORR. Herein, we develop a novel strategy to fulfill this mission by designing a Fe–Mo dual-atom center site embedded in an N-doped carbon substrate (FeMo–N–C). The introduction of an Fe–Mo atomic pair can effectively manipulate the electronic configuration and downshift the d-band center of Fe, thus lessening the adsorption of ORR intermediates and thereby facilitating the ORR at the Fe–Mo active moiety. This architecture offers a tailored electronic configuration and optimized geometric structure, which downshift the d-band center of Fe, elongate the O–O length, and thus favor the cracking of O–O bonds, showing excellent ORR activity in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte.
In this work, we synthesized Fe–Mo dual-metal atom sites coordinated on an N-doped carbon support (FeMo–N–C) by a general host–guest strategy as shown in Figure 1a. (68−70) First, a MoO2(acac)2 molecule was encapsulated in the cage of an in situ grown bimetallic FeZn-zeolite imidazolate framework (FeZn-ZIF) through a self-assembly process. Then the Mo-embedded FeZn-ZIF (Mo-FeZn-ZIF) was pyrolyzed to achieve a porous carbon-based catalyst under the protection of flowing nitrogen (for the X-ray diffraction characterization of Mo-FeZn-ZIF and FeZn-ZIF, see Figure S1). The morphology of the as-synthesized FeMo–N–C was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as shown in Figure 1b and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Figure 1c. FeMo–N–C has a dodecahedral shape with a uniform diameter (∼100 nm). The corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Figure 1c implies a relatively good crystallinity of the three-dimensional porous carbon. The graphitic property of FeMo–N–C was confirmed by Raman spectra with an ID/IG intensity ratio of about 1.00 (Figure S2), which is conducive to fast electron transport at the electrode. The broad D band implies that there are large numbers of defects existing in the carbon matrix, which could be a result of the doping of nitrogen species and the formation of pores, edges, and disorders during the pyrolysis process. (71) Doping pyrolyzed carbon with nitrogen has been recognized as an effective way to improve its electrical conductivity. (72,73) Moreover, nitrogen dopants could be utilized to immobilize single metal atoms. The high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of N 1s shown in Figure S3 reveals the coexistence of graphitic N (401.7 eV), pyrrolic N (400.6 eV), Fe–Nx/Mo–Nx (399.1 eV), and pyridinic N (398.3 eV), affirming the existence of metal–Nx coordination bonding. A nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm investigation reveals a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area (877 m2 g–1) of FeMo–N–C with an average pore diameter of 1.43 nm (estimated from the nitrogen desorption isotherms by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method, Figure S4), which would be advantageous for the contraction of adsorbed ORR-relevant species at the exposed surface sites. (74) The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image (Figure 1d) reveals the absence of any metallic particles over the entire architecture (along with the two-dimensional imaging; see the Supplementary Movie for a 3D representation of FeMo–N–C by HAADF-STEM tomography). The homogeneous elemental distributions of Fe, Mo, and N in the carbon support were verified by the corresponding energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images of the FeMo–N–C catalyst (Figure 1h). In addition, no evident diffraction peaks belonging to Fe or Mo species are observed in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, further ruling out the formation of large metallic crystals (Figure S5). With the aid of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), the loading amounts of Fe and Mo are determined to be 0.78 and 0.71 wt %, respectively. It is the severely controlled concentrations of the Fe and Mo precursors (Figures S6 and S7 for aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM images of FeMo–N–C when the concentrations of these Fe and Mo precursors vary) and the appearance of free N-coordination sites after the evaporation of low-boiling-point Zn in the carbon substrate that promote the formation of atomically dispersed metal sites instead of randomly assembled metal/alloy particles. The existence of atomically dispersed sites was then corroborated by the aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image in Figure 1e. Due to the Z-contrast between metal atoms and nitrogen/carbon atoms, bright dots assigned to heavier metal atoms can be easily discerned and they are distributed all over the carbon framework. Fe/Mo atomic pairs are highlighted by larger red circles. Corresponding electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) suggests the coexistence of Fe and Mo in these atomic pairs (Figures S8 and S9). Individual Fe or Mo single atoms are marked with green circles. The distances of Fe–Mo bimetallic sites in the regions 1, 2, and 3 marked in Figure 1e are ∼0.27 nm, as illustrated in the accessional intensity profiles (Figure 1f). The statistical survey in Figure 1g reveals that a majority (∼70%) of the bright dots were counted as dot pairs representing the dual metallic sites, and the corresponding statistical diatomic distances were centered at about 0.3 nm (Figure 1g).

To further investigate the local structural information on FeMo–N–C, the samples were analyzed by synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy. The normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) curves of the Fe and Mo K-edge of FeMo–N–C along with their corresponding reference samples are displayed in Figure 2a,b, respectively. The near-edge absorption of FeMo–N–C at the Fe K-edge is similar to that of Fe2O3, and the energy position is situated between those of Fe2O3 and Fe foil, meaning that the Fe site is in a positive valence state (+0 < δ < +3). Similarly, the near-edge absorption energy position of the Mo K-edge for FeMo–N–C is located between those of Mo foil and MoO3, implying a positive valence state at the Mo active site center (+0 < δ < +6). The pre-edge peak at ∼7112 eV was ascribed to the 1s–4pz transitions, indicating the fingerprint of Fe–N4 coordination. (75)

(g) Wavelet transforms of these k2-weighted χ(k) signals of FeMo–N–C and reference samples at the Fe and Mo K-edge.
To further identify the coordination environment of Fe and Mo atoms, the Fourier-transformed (FT) k2-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were investigated in R space. The dominant peaks at ∼1.5 Å in Figure 2c and at 1.2 Å in Figure 2d of FeMo–N–C are assigned to the Fe–N and Mo–N scattering paths, respectively. Compared to Fe and Mo foil references, peaks attributed to the Fe–Fe (2.2 Å) and Mo–Mo (2.4 Å) scattering paths are negligible, suggesting that the Fe and Mo atoms are distributed atomically over FeMo–N–C. The Fe and Mo configurations in FeMo–N–C were analyzed quantitatively by least-squares fitting procedures, as shown in Figure 2e,f, Figures S10 and S11, and Table S1. The k2-weighted FT-EXAFS spectra were both well-fitted at Fe and Mo K-edge by inserting the structural model of FeMo-N6, in which each metal atom coordinates with four nitrogen atoms. A peak at ∼2.7 Å which is a contribution of the Fe–Mo path can be detected at both the Fe and Mo K-edge FT-EXAFS spectra of FeMo–N–C, demonstrating the presence of Fe–Mo bonds. The Fe–Mo bond length extracted is in line with the distance measured from the AC-STEM image in Figure 1e of this two conjoined metal atoms, therefore verifying the existence of a Fe–Mo dual-metal site.
Figure 2g shows the wavelet transform (WT) contour plots of these k2-weighted χ(k) signals derived from Morlet wavelets with an optimal resolution. The peak intensity has various coordinates of (k, R), whose location is dependent on the atomic number Z and path length R. The WT contour plot of the FeMo–N–C at the Fe K-edge possesses a predominant intensity maximum at ∼4 Å–1, which is assigned to the Fe–N coordination. Similarly, the WT contour plot for the Mo K-edge of FeMo–N–C displays a maximum intensity at ∼5 Å–1, which corresponds to Mo–N coordination. In contrast to the contour plots of the reference samples, no characteristic Fe–Fe or Mo–Mo signals are observed (Figure 2g). These analyses confirmed that the coordination paths in FeMo–N–C are Fe–N/Mo–N and Fe–Mo.
To measure the ORR catalytic performance of FeMo–N–C, linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were performed using a rotating-disk electrode (RDE) in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte. The performances of Fe–N–C, Mo–N–C, and commercial 20 wt % Pt/C were also tested as comparisons, as shown in Figure 3a. As expected, the well-defined FeMo–N–C catalyst delivered outstanding electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR with a high half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.84 V and a positive onset potential (Eonset) of 0.98 V among the as-prepared catalysts. It outperformed the pristine single-atom-site counterpart of Fe–N–C (E1/2 of 0.77 V, Eonset of 0.91 V). Moreover, this ORR performance of FeMo–N–C is comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C and surpasses most of the reported NPMCs (Table S2) in acidic electrolyte. The kinetic current density (jk) is 23.5 mA cm–2 at 0.8 V, further manifesting the superior ORR catalytic activity of FeMo–N–C. Thejk value of FeMo–N–C is much greater than the sum of those of Fe–N–C and Mo–N–C (Figure 3b), indicating the existence of a synergistic effect between Fe–N–C and Mo–N–C sites. The Tafel slope derived from the polarization curve was further used to discern the reaction kinetic character in the ORR. As shown in Figure 3c, FeMo–N–C possesses the fastest ORR kinetics, exhibiting the lowest Tafel slope of 52 mV dec–1 among these tested samples. To further extract the electron transfer number (n), LSV at various rotating rates of the RDE (from 400 to 2025 rpm) was performed, as shown in Figure 3d. As calculated from the Koutecky–Levich (K-L) equation at different rotating speeds, the n value of 3.99 (Figure S12) for FeMo–N–C suggests that it goes through a favorable four-electron path for the ORR. The hypothesis was confirmed by a subsequent rotating ring–disk electrode (RRDE) characterization, with n approaching 4 and an H2O2 yield of lower than 1.0% (Figure 3e). A H2/O2 full cell was assembled to evaluate the potential for practical application in acidic electrolyte, in which FeMo–N–C was used as the cathodic catalyst. As a result, a peak power density of 460 mW cm was delivered, which is ∼83% of that with the commercial Pt/C counterpart (Figure 3f), manifesting the excellent performance as a NPMC.

Long-term durability is another important criterion for a qualified ORR catalyst. As revealed in Figure S13, the as-synthesized FeMo–N–C shows negligible degradation of catalytic activity after 5000 accelerated CV cycles. The morphology was also retained well, and no obvious Fe particles were observed after the stability test, as examined by the HAADF-STEM image shown in Figure S14. Moreover, a methanol injection brought a severe decay in the current density of the commercial Pt/C catalyst during the chronoamperometric measurement, while no significant oscillation was detected in the current density of FeMo–N–C, as shown in Figure S15, demonstrating its excellent resistance to methanol.
The ORR process was simulated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the active site and catalytic mechanism of FeMo–N–C. It should be noted that the adsorption Gibbs free energy of *OH (ΔGOH*) onto FeMo–N–C is negative at the working potential, suggesting that the bonding of an OH ligand is an exothermic process and happens proactively, forming a FeMo–N6–(OH) structure and remaining stable during the whole ORR process. Similarly, an OH ligand also adsorbs to the MoN4 site spontaneously. Otherwise, the mononuclear FeN4 site shows a positive value of ΔGOH*, implying no spontaneous attachment of OH onto the single Fe atom site.
The reaction mechanism in acidic aqueous solution is considered. The ORR proceeds through an O2 → *O2 → *OOH → *O → *OH → H2O reaction path for these structures. As manifested in the free energy diagrams in Figure 4a, all elementary steps are exothermic, since all the reaction steps are downhill for the outstanding FeMo–N6–(OH) at U = 0.83 V. This means that the ORR occurs preferentially on the dual metal atom sites of FeMo–N6–(OH). At the equilibrium potential (U = 1.23 V), the steps of *O2 to *OOH on both the FeMo–N6–(OH) and mononuclear FeN4 and MoN4 are uphill in energy and thermodynamically unfavorable (Figure 4b). As shown in Figure 4c, at U = 0, exceptionally for Mo–N4, the fourth reaction step of the ORR, from *O to*OH, is an endothermic process, showing that Mo–N4 is a poor ORR catalyst. Moreover, the cleavage of an O–O bond is deemed to be much more facile on the dual metal atom site as a result of the prioritized bridge-cis adsorption model of O2, while the adsorption manner turns to be a side-on model on the mononuclear sites (Figure S16). This was further confirmed by the stretched O–O bond length of 1.373 Å extracted from the FeMo–N6–OH site compared to that of 1.207 Å on the counterpart FeN4 site. This elongated O–O bond length then passionately activate the *OOH + H+ + e– → *O + H2O step. The theoretical calculation analyses verified the advantages of this novel FeMo–N6–OH configuration, which is crucial for the four-electron-transfer oxygen reduction, boosting the ORR performance. Based on the discussion above, the proposed ORR mechanism of these dual metal single atoms sites is depicted in Figure 4d.

According to the d-band model theory when another metal Mo is introduced into the FeNx moiety, the downward shift in Fe d-orbital center from −0.75 to −0.93 eV (Figure S17) would optimize the absorption–desorption behavior of ORR intermediates and thus facilitate the rate-limiting step and finally decrease the overall reaction energy barriers.
In summary, we constructed a Fe–Mo dual metal site electrocatalyst dispersed in a porous nitrogen-doped carbon substrate for a high-efficiency ORR in acidic electrolyte. The breaking of a O–O bond is much more facile on the Fe–Mo atomic pair site as a result of the preferred bridge-cis adsorption model of oxygen molecules. By introducing an Mo atom to the FeNx center and forming an FeMoN6 active moiety, the downward shift of Fe d-orbital center optimizes the absorption–desorption behavior of ORR intermediates and thus reduces the reaction barrier of the rate-determining step and finally enhances the catalytic activity. The catalytic test based on RDE/RRDE (three-electrode half-cell system) and the assembled H2/O2 full cell exhibits its potential in replacing the Pt-group catalysts.
