Introduction
Hydrogen fuel cells have attracted intensive attention as a type of energy conversion device with high efficiency and low/zero emission. (1, 2) Despite the great efforts worldwide over the past decades, their massive applications in daily life are still a challenge due to the scarce resource, high cost, and durability issues of the current commercial Pt/C catalysts. (2-4) Thus, exploring non-noble metal or even metal-free catalysts with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability is absolutely crucial for the development of fuel cells. Presently, promising results involving non-noble metal cobalt–polypyrrole (5) and Fe–N complexes (6, 7) as well as metal-free poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), (4) nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs), (8) and nitrogen-doped graphene (9) have been published with excellent electrocatalytic performance for the ORR. The NCNTs are especially promising due to their large surface area, good thermal and chemical stability, and high electrical conductivity. (8, 10-19) The NCNTs with high nitrogen contents (5.5–8 at. %) have comparable catalytic activity while a higher stability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline solution. (8, 12, 13, 19) The transferred electron number (n) per oxygen molecule involved in the ORR on the NCNTs is 3.5–3.9, suggesting that most O2 molecules could be directly reduced to the terminal product, H2O. (8, 12, 13, 19) Particularly, the three-dimensional (3D) aligned NCNTs were presented to exhibit a 3 times higher electrocatalytic activity than the Pt/C catalyst, probably due to the large electrochemically active surface area and high electrolyte diffusion rate of this unique structure. (8, 14, 20) However, a complex process was needed to transfer the 3D NCNTs from a SiO2/Si wafer to an electrode. If aligned NCNTs were directly grown on a carbon support, the transfer and binding process could be simplified or even excluded. Graphene is an ideal support because of its planar structure suitable for NCNT growth and excellent physicochemical properties as an electrode material. The recent studies have demonstrated that quasi- or aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could be grown on graphene to form 3D CNTs/graphene (CNTs/G) hybrid materials. (21-24) The 3D CNTs/G with a high surface area (612 m2/g) was shown to have high rates of ion and electron transport in the application of supercapacitors. (21) In this study, we have prepared 3D NCNTs/graphene (NCNTs/G) using pyridine and graphene oxide (GO) as the corresponding precursors. The catalytic activity of undoped CNTs/G and NCNTs/G in the ORR was studied electrochemically, aiming at providing new insight for constructing metal-free electrocatalysts.
Experimental Section
Synthesis of Graphite Oxide
Graphite oxide was synthesized by the modified Hummers method. (25, 26) In short, 1 g of natural graphite (325 mesh, Alfa Aesar) was added to 50 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid under stirring and an ice–water bath. A 6 g portion of potassium permanganate was then slowly added, and the mixture was stirred at 30 °C for 1 h. Next, 80 mL of distilled water was added, and the mixture was further stirred for 30 min with increasing the temperature to 90 °C. Finally, 200 mL of distilled water and 6 mL of H2O2 (30%) were subsequently added dropwise, turning the color of the solution from dark brown to yellow. The generated solid graphite oxide was separated by centrifugation, washed, and finally dried under vacuum.
Preparation of Ni/rGO Composite
A 180 mg portion of graphite oxide was dispersed into 360 mL of ethanol by sonication for 1 h to form a 0.5 mg/mL GO suspension. A 5.16 mL portion of 0.1 mol/L NiCl2/ethanol solution was then dropped into the GO solution and magnetically stirred for 12 h at room temperature. Next, under vigorous stirring, 2.5 mL of hydrazine was added into the mixture at ∼60 °C. The generated flocculent solid was separated by filtration and thoroughly washed with ethanol and deionized water several times, and finally vacuum-dried at ∼60 °C.
Preparation of NCNTs/G Composite
A 50 mg portion of Ni/rGO powder was placed in a quartz tube furnace and then heated under a H2 (20 sccm) and Ar (65 sccm) mixture gas from room temperature to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. A 2 mL portion of pyridine was then injected continuously into the reactor at a rate of 50 μL/min and carried to the reaction zone by the mixture gas. After reaction, the reactor was cooled in Ar to room temperature and a dark product was obtained. Undoped CNTs/G was also synthesized by a similar process using benzene as a precursor. The products were treated with HCl solution (1:1) at 85 °C for 6 h to remove the exposed Ni catalyst.
Characterization
The products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Philips X’pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation of 1.5418 Å), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-JEM-1005 at 100 kV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI5000 VersaProbe), and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia Raman Microscope with an argon-ion laser at an excitation wavelength of 514 nm).
Electrochemical measurements, including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) voltammetries, were carried out at 25 °C on a CHI 760C workstation (CH Instruments). Hg/HgO and platinum wire served as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The RDE and RRDE voltammetry experiments were performed on an MSR electrode rotator (Pine Instrument Co.). CV and RDE voltammetries were collected with a glassy carbon (GC) electrode (5 mm diameter), whereas RRDE voltammetry used a GC disk electrode (5 mm diameter) surrounded by a Pt ring (6.5 mm inside diameter). The GC electrode was modified as follows: Simply, 5 mg of catalyst was dispersed into a 5 mL mixture of water, ethanol, and Nafion (DuPont, 5 wt %) with the volume ratio of 1:3.85:0.15 by ultrasonication, and a suspension with a concentration of 1.0 mg mL–1 was obtained. The catalyst suspension above was then dropped onto the glassy carbon disk (GC) intermittently; 0.5 μL of Nafion (Dupont, 5 wt %) was coated to the surface of the thin-film electrode and dried thoroughly in air. ORR evaluation was performed in 0.1 mol L–1 KOH electrolyte saturated and protected by O2. The electrochemical performances of all the catalysts were examined in 0.1 M KOH solution.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the typical SEM images of the CNTs/G and NCNTs/G composites before and after acid treatment. As can be seen from Figure 1a,b, tangled CNTs and NCNTs with lengths of several hundred nanometers grow on both sides of the graphene, forming a quasi-aligned CNT or NCNT array. It can be observed that some catalyst nanoparticles exist at the tip of the nanotubes, especially for the CNTs. Many catalysts are encapsulated in the NCNT, which will be seen in the following TEM observation. After acid washing, the CNTs and NCNTs are still tightly attached on the graphene sheets and the 3D structure is well-maintained (Figure 1c,d), suggesting that the 3D NCNTs/G composite is tough enough for use as an electrocatalyst.

The TEM images of the CNTs/G and NCNTs/G composites after acid treatment are presented in Figure 2, which depict that CNTs and NCNTs are multiwalled and sparsely distributed on a thin graphene sheet. The outer and inner diameters of these tubes are in the ranges of 40–45 and 30–40 nm, respectively. After HCl washing, the catalyst nanoparticles in CNTs/G are well-removed, whereas some of them in the NCNTs/G composite still remained due to the encapsulation by carbon shells, as marked by the arrows. According to our previous study, the remaining catalyst nanoparticles covered by carbon shells do not give obvious electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR. (27)

The XRD curves for the CNTs/G and NCNTs/G composites before and after acid washing are given in Figure 3a. All samples exhibit the graphitic peaks at about 26.22° from the graphite layers in CNTs, NCNTs, and the graphene support. Before acid treatment, the as-grown CNTs/G and NCNTs/G also give the diffraction peaks of Ni(111) and Ni(200) at about 41.47 and 51.80°, which originated from the Ni catalyst. After acid treatment, the intensity of the Ni peak for CNTs/G is largely depressed, whereas that for NCNTs/G changes slightly, indicating that the catalyst in CNTs/G could be effectively removed by acid dissolution, whereas some Ni catalyst still remained in the NCNTs/G composite, well consistent with the TEM observation. Raman spectra of the CNTs/G and NCNTs/G composites (Figure 3b) shows two peaks centered at ∼1351 cm–1 (D band) and ∼1586 cm–1 (G band). The G band is assigned to one of the two E2g modes corresponding to stretching vibrations in the basal plane (sp2 domains) of single-crystal graphite or graphene. (28) The D band is usually attributed to the disorder and imperfection of the carbon crystallites. (28) As known, the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) in the Raman spectrum should approximately correspond to the extent of disorder in the graphitic carbon. (29) The ID/IG of NCNTs/G is 1.46, higher than that of CNTs/G (0.90). This suggests that the NCNTs/G has a lower graphitic crystalline structure, which should be caused by the nitrogen doping. (29)

The nitrogen state and content in the NCNTs/G composite were analyzed by XPS. The survey scan together with N 1s XPS spectra are given in Figure 4, and the corresponding element contents are listed in Table 1. From the survey scan spectra in Figure 4a, it is seen that the NCNTs/G sample shows a distinct N signal, as expected. Ni 2p signals are not observed, as shown in Figure 4a, and the Ni content was measured to be zero (Table 1), suggesting that the Ni catalysts exposed on the surface of the composites were effectively removed by the acid treatment during sample purification. The O 1s peak for NCNTs/G is slightly higher than that for CNTs/G, which should be caused by the existence of N-oxide species, as analyzed below. The N 1s spectrum for NCNTs/G (Figure 4b) can be fitted into five N entities, including pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, N-oxide, and N2, with binding energies of 398.3, 400.5, 401.5, 403.5, and 405.0 eV, respectively. (12, 30) The total N content in NCNTs/G was measured to be 6.6 at. %, and the relative amounts of the five types of N species are calculated from the corresponding fitted peaks to be 35.22, 35.11, 12.24, 8.54, and 8.89%, respectively.

The proceeding experimental results indicate that 3D NCNTs/G composed of quasi-aligned NCNTs and a graphene support has been prepared. The largely exposed NCNTs with a high N content and connected by a graphene sheet would give a high electrocatalytic activity to the ORR in view of the large electrochemically active surface area and high electrolyte diffusion rate of such a structure. (13, 19) The electrocatalytic activities of the CNTs/G and NCNTs/G composites were evaluated by CV and RDE voltammetries (Figure 5). The catalytic activity of a catalyst to the ORR could be qualitatively estimated from the onset potential and peak current depicted in CV. A catalyst with a higher electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR will demonstrate an earlier onset potential and a higher peak current. Accordingly, its RDE voltammogram should also show a sooner current drop with a positively shifted onset potential and a higher steady-state current. From the CV curves (Figure 5a), it is seen that the onset and reduction peak potentials of the ORR for CNTs/G are at −0.219 ± 0.002 and −0.338 ± 0.006 V, whereas those for NCNTs/G are at −0.181 ± 0.001 and −0.312 ± 0.002 V, respectively. Compared with CNTs/G, NCNTs/G exhibited the positively shifted onset and peak potentials as well as the higher peak current density (1.423 ± 0.022 mA/mg), clearly indicating a significant ORR activity enhancement by nitrogen doping. The ORR performance of the two metal-free electrocatalysts was further evaluated by RDE voltammetry and compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20%, Johnson Matthey) (Figure 5b). As can be seen, the onset potential of the ORR for the NCNTs/G is ∼ –0.191 V, which is much higher than that of the CNTs/G composite (∼ –0.248 V). Moreover, at a given applied potential, the ORR current of the NCNTs/G composite is significantly stronger than that of the CNTs/G composite. These are well consistent with the CV results. The onset potential for the NCNTs/G composite is lower than that of the Pt/C catalyst (∼ –0.112 V), though its limiting diffusion current is close to that of the Pt/C catalyst. The present performance of the 3D NCNTs/G would be further enhanced if the nitrogen content and state are optimized according to the reports for NCNTs. (8, 12, 20)

RDE experiments were also carried out to quantitatively evaluate the electrocatalytic activities of the CNTs/G and NCNTs/G composites toward the ORR using the Koutecky–Levich (K-L) equation
where the limiting current (jlim) is related to the Levich current (jlev) and the kinetic current (jk). F is the Faraday constant (96486.4 C mol–1), D is the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in water (1.9 × 10–5 cm2 s–1), υ is the kinematic viscosity of water (0.01 cm2 s–1), C is the concentration of O2, and ω is the rotation rate of RDE. Figure 6 gives the RDE linear sweep voltammograms at different rotation rates for the CNTs/G and NCNTs/G composites (Figure 6a,c) and the derived linear plot of jlim–1 versus ω–1/2 with a slope of 1/0.62nFCD2/3υ–1/6 (Figure 6b,d). The calculated n values for the CNTs/G at the potentials of −0.5, −0.6, and −0.7 V are 2.265 ± 0.082, 2.332 ± 0.058, and 2.517 ± 0.048, indicating that most O2 are reduced to peroxide via a two-electron (2e) process, whereas the n values for the NCNTs/G are 3.483 ± 0.044, 3.478 ± 0.065, and 3.525 ± 0.057 at −0.5, −0.6, and −0.7 V, suggesting that NCNTs/G has a higher selectivity to reduce O2 to H2O.

K-L plots of j–1 vs ω1/2 obtained from the RDE data at −0.5, −0.6, and −0.7 V for CNTs/G (b) and NCNTs/G (d). Error bars represent standard deviations of duplicate tests.
The n value involved in the ORR could also be calculated based on the RRDE voltammograms. Here, n was obtained from the equation of n = 4Idisk/(Idisk + Iring/N), (11, 31) where Idisk is the Faradic disk current and Iring is the Faradic ring current, and the collection efficiency N is 0.27. In this case, n is calculated to be 2.43 for the CNTs/G and 3.51 for the NCNTs/G when a stable Idisk is reached around −0.60 V (Figure 7a), which agrees well with the values calculated from the K-L equation. The conversion of O2 on NCNTs/G to H2O at −0.60 V is calculated to be 76%, much higher than that on CNTs/G (22%).

Conclusion
A strategy to synthesize 3D NCNTs was developed based on the usage of graphene sheets as a support. The so-prepared NCNTs/G composite has been demonstrated to exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity for the ORR. The transferred electron number on it is about 3.5. Though the performance of the current NCNTs/G is not as good as that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, in view of the merits of the 3D structure and the progress on metal-free NCNT electrocatalysts, it is believed that its activity could be further elevated by increasing the nitrogen content, optimizing the nitrogen state, and improving the 3D structure.
