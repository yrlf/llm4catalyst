Introduction
With ever-increasing global energy demands and environmental issues of consuming fossil fuels, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing sustainable and clean energy technologies. (1-3) Among different solutions, electrocatalytic water splitting through oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has attracted tremendous attention because the generated H2 can be utilized as a clean energy source. (4-6) Based on thermodynamic theory, OER is an uphill reaction, which involves the transformation of four electrons at a high overpotential. (7, 8) To date, noble metal/metal oxides such as platinum (Pt), ruthenium oxides (RuO2), and iridium oxides (IrO2) are still considered the most efficient electrocatalysts for OER. (9-11) Nevertheless, poor stability, low cost, and scarcity of platinum-group metals seriously hinder their utilization in industrial-scale technology. (12, 13) Therefore, development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements to gain sustainable hydrogen production would be highly desirable. (14, 15) To date, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to exploring noble-metal-free electrocatalysts, such as copper oxide, cobalt oxide, and manganese oxide, as electrocatalysts for OER. (16, 17) Among these transition metal oxide catalysts, cobalt oxides have attracted much attention due to their excellent catalytic activity and remarkable stability.
As electrocatalysts for OER, bulk metal oxides are usually less active because of their low surface area and poor conductivity. The electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4 is affected by the specific surface area as well as the surface electronic state. Larger surface area of Co3O4 can provide more accessible sites for electrochemical reactions. Numerous nanostructures have been designed to improve the catalytic activity of Co3O4 for OER. For example, Dai and co-workers (18) have synthesized Co3O4/N-doped graphene hybrid material, which consists of Co3O4 nanoparticles grown directly on a nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheet. As electrocatalyst for OER, Co3O4/N-doped graphene shows a very low overpotential of 0.31 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 with a small Tafel slope of 67 mV/decade, exhibiting significantly improved catalytic activity over that of Co3O4 or graphene oxide alone. The small crystalline size and conductive support contribute to the electrocatalytic activity for OER. Moreover, Yan and co-workers (19) have designed porous MnOx/nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) hybrid nanorods with an extremely high specific surface area of 135 m2/g. The hierarchical porosity facilitates mass transfer within the electrode. At a current density of 10 mA/cm2, it exhibits an overpotential of 1.67 V with Tafel slope of 56 mV/decade. (19)
Recently, heterostructured nanomaterials have stimulated more and more interest since multifunctionality of nanomaterials can be realized via designing morphology and manipulating the composition of original components. In particular, three-dimensional nanoarchitectures have been widely studied in the fields of energy storage devices and conversion, due to their unique benefits such as robust structure, tremendous surface-active sites, and synergistic physical or chemical properties from different components. For example, Fan and co-workers (20) have designed TiO2@Fe2O3 hollow nanostructures as an advanced anode material for improved lithium ion storage. In this TiO2@Fe2O3 hierarchical structure, TiO2 nanotubes provide a stable backbone and growth platform for Fe2O3, while Fe2O3 nanospikes outside the tubes provide efficient conductive paths for electrons. Therefore, enhanced cyclic stability and rate capability are achieved. In addition, Wang and co-workers (21) reported the preparation of Co@nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes as a superior electrocatalyst for OER and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The remarkable performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of chemical components as well as the stable nanoarchitecture. Lu and Zhao (22) have deposited hierarchically structured nickel–iron composite nanosheets onto porous nickel foam substrates by electrodeposition. The designed electrode exhibits improved catalytic activity for water oxidation in alkaline solutions due to its very high specific surface area and electrical integrity. However, it still remains a great challenge to control the sizes, dimensions, and crystalline/amorphous components of the building blocks of hierarchical nanomaterials.
Additionally, the surface electronic states of Co3O4 can be adjusted by doping with a third element, controlling the facet, or introducing oxygen vacancies. Tuning oxygen vacancies of transition metal oxides would also greatly change their catalytic activity. Co3O4 is of mixed valence with the presence of Co2+ and Co3+. Proper control of the Co2+/Co3+ ratio in Co3O4 can result in great changes in its electronic and thus catalytic properties. For example, Dai and co-workers (23) have prepared Co3O4 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies by a plasma engraving strategy. The generated oxygen vacancies on the Co3O4 surface significantly improve the electronic conductivity and also generate more active edges for reaction of OER. As an OER electrocatalyst, Co3O4 with oxygen vacancies shows improved current density and lower onset potential than those of pristine Co3O4. Moreover, Zheng and co-workers (24) have synthesized reduced Co3O4 mesoporous nanowires for application as electrocatalysts for water oxidation. After reduction, mesoporous Co3O4 nanowires show a current of 13.1 mA/cm2 at a potential of 1.65 V. From the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, oxygen vacancies may lead to the generation of new gap states. Moreover, the electrons associated with Co–O bonds have a tendency to be delocalized, leading to improved electrocatalytic activity and electrical conductivity. (23, 24) Recently, Burke et al. (25) have studied the crucial role of Fe impurities incorporated in Co-based materials acting as OER electrocatalysts. They hypothesized that Fe substituting for Co can serve as an active site for OER catalysis, while CoOOH provides a conductive and stable host for Fe.
Herein, to combine all these merits and improve the electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4, we rationally design and prepare Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons by thermal annealing of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) followed by self-assembly growth of Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires. The pristine ZIF-67 hollow polyhedrons are subjected to two steps of thermal treatment, forming Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons. It is found that the Co3O4 component in this structure has oxygen vacancies on the surface, as characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Inner Co3O4 nanoparticles with oxygen vacancies, which are embedded in the carbon hollow polyhedron matrix, can create more active defects for OER, durably supply highly efficient electronic conductivity, and provide strong structural stability. Moreover, oxygen vacancies on the surface of Co3O4 nanoparticles also serve as nucleation sites for growth of crystalline Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires. Tiny crystalline Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires directly grow on the hollow Co3O4 polyhedrons, forming a novel heterostructure. The designed Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons display significantly improved current density and a much lower overpotential as OER electrocatalysts. The advantage of such structure lies in the synergistic effect of integrated Co3O4–x-carbon and Fe2–yCoyO3 components as well as the unique heterostructure. In particular, as shown in Figure 1, the tiny Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires directly grown on the surface of hollow polyhedrons have a very high surface area, providing numerous active sites for OER. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the heterostructure of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 has been designed and synthesized with a controllable method. More significantly, this strategy opens a new and facile avenue for fabricating complex structured composite nanomaterials, which has great potential for future electrocatalysts and for other energy/environmental applications.
Experimental Section
Synthesis of Co3O4–x-Carbon Hollow Polyhedrons
ZIF-67 was prepared via a typical precipitation method. Briefly, 3.94 g of 2-methylimidazole was dissolved in a mixed solution of ethanol (40 mL) and methanol (40 mL). Co(NO3)2·6H2O (3.51 g) was dissolved in another mixed solution of methanol (40 mL) and ethanol (40 mL). Then these two solutions above were combined under stirring. The final solution was kept for 20 h under continuous stirring. The resultant purple powder was collected by centrifugation, washed with ethanol three times, and dried overnight at 70 °C. Afterward, ZIF-67 powder was annealed at 600 °C for 2 h in nitrogen. After that, the Co3O4-carbon hollow polyhedrons were further annealed at 200 °C for 20 min in air. (21, 26)
Preparation of Co3O4 Hollow Polyhedrons
Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons were prepared by annealing ZIF-67 powder at 290 °C for 2 h in air at a heating rate of 2 °C/min. (27)
Synthesis of Co3O4–x-Carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 Heterostructural Hollow Polyhedrons
Co3O4-carbon hollow polyhedrons (30 mg) were dispersed in deionized water (30 mL). FeSO4·7H2O (0.242 g) was added, and the solution was kept stirring for 20 h. Afterward, the resultant products were collected by centrifugation, washed with water and ethanol several times, and dried overnight at 70 °C. (28)
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of all the samples were recorded by Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffraction measurement in the 2θ range 5°–90° with a scanning rate of 2°/min, using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) data were recorded on an AXIS165 spectrometer using a twin-anode Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray as the excitation source with the charge neutralization function being turned on. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) imaging and energy-dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) mapping were performed on a FEI Quanta 3D FEG field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Microstructure was observed on a JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (TEM).
Electrochemical Measurements
Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured with a rotating disk electrode controller (AFMSRCE, Pine Instrument Co.) connected to a CHI 6504C electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc.). In a typical three-electrode system, a platinum wire was used as counter electrode and a HydroFlex was used as reference electrode. To prepare catalyst film-coated glassy carbon working electrode, powders (8 mg) were dispersed in 2 mL of freshly prepared dispersion solution (ethanol/Nafion = 100:1 v/v), followed by sonication for 1 h. Afterward, 10 μL of fresh catalyst ink was deposited on a rotating disk electrode with geometric area 0.196 cm2 by a house-built spin-coating device under gentle airflow. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) property of the catalysts was studied by LSV. For the stability test, the potential was swept at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in the range 0.2–0.65 V with an electrode rotation rate of 1600 rpm in N2-saturated 1 M KOH aqueous solution.
Results and Discussion
Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons were synthesized via a three-step procedure as illustrated in Figure 1. ZIF-67 polyhedrons were first synthesized via a typical precipitation method with the precursors of Co(NO3)2 and 2-methylimidazole in mixed solvent. Then, the ZIF-67 polyhedrons were sintered in nitrogen. During this process, well-defined Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons were formed by carbonization of ZIF-67. Meanwhile, the surface of Co3O4 nanoparticles was reduced by the carbon matrix, forming oxygen vacancies there. In the last step, the as-formed Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons were ultrasonically dispersed in aqueous ferrous sulfate solution. Interestingly, Fe2–yCoyO3 not only heterogeneously nucleates on the defects of Co3O4–x nanoparticles but also epitaxially grows into nanowires, forming the heterostructure.

Schematic showing growth process of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons: (I) formation of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons structures via two steps of annealing ZIF-67 hollow polyhedrons; (II) nucleation of Fe2–yCoyO3 on defects in Co3O4–x; (III) epitaxial growth of Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires on the surface of hollow polyhedrons to form Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructures.
FESEM characterization has been performed to investigate the morphology of the samples at each step. Figure S1 manifests the morphology of well-defined ZIF-67 polyhedrons. It can be clearly observed that the polyhedral shapes and sizes of ZIF-67 particles are quite uniform. Some polyhedrons display open voids, which indicate hollow structures. Figure 2 shows SEM images of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons and Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons. As displayed clearly in Figure 2a,b, Co3O4–x-carbon maintains the size, hollow structure, and polyhedral shape of ZIF-67 after thermal treatment. With a thickness of about 20 nm, the Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons are composed of carbon framework and tiny Co3O4–x nanoparticles with oxygen vacancies on the surface. After dispersion in aqueous ferrous sulfate, Fe2–yCoyO3 nucleates on the defects of Co3O4–x nanoparticles and then epitaxially grows into nanowires. As shown in Figure 2c,d, the polyhedral shape is retained well after solution-phase growth, while the surface becomes fluffy. As displayed clearly in Figure 2d, many tiny nanofibers can be observed on the surface of polyhedrons. In addition, open voids in some polyhedrons indicate the maintained hollow structures. The hierarchical shells are composed of Co3O4–x-carbon with Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires grown on them. The composition of the composite sample was also investigated by EDS mapping. In Figure 3, EDS elemental mapping of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons was performed. Cobalt, carbon, iron, and oxygen are distributed homogeneously across the entire sample. Moreover, high-resolution EDS mapping in Figure S2 further confirms the uniform elemental distribution in individual polyhedrons. The atomic ratio of Fe to Co is about 3:4 (Figure S2).

TEM characterization was also used to further investigate the microstructure. Figure 4 presents TEM and HRTEM images of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons. The TEM image in Figure 4a confirms the hollow structure of polyhedrons, which are composed of the polyhedronlike framework with numerous tiny nanowires grown on it. In Figure 4b, the high-resolution (HRTEM) image confirms the diameter of nanowires is around 3.5 nm. In addition, the HRTEM image reveals that these nanowires are crystalline and the lattice fringes have d-spacings of 3.0 Å, which is ascribed to the (220) plane of Fe2–yCoyO3 (Figures S4 and S5). The corresponding SEM images, EDS, and TEM images all clearly confirm the morphology and structural phase of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons.

To confirm the crystalline structure of the as-prepared samples, XRD measurements were carried out. Figure S3 shows the XRD pattern of pristine ZIF-67. It is observed that the main diffraction peaks from (011), (002), (112), and (222) planes, are in good accordance with previous reports. (21) After sintering in nitrogen gas, the XRD patterns of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons indicate ZIF-67 nanoparticles were totally converted into Co3O4, as displayed in Figure 5a. The XRD pattern of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons displays peaks at 19.2°, 31.5°, 36.8°, 44.8°, 59.4°, and 65.2°, corresponding to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511), and (440) planes of Co3O4, respectively. In comparison with that of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons, the XRD pattern of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons exhibits three more peaks at 9.8°, 19.5°, and 26.3°. The index of these three hkl peaks indicates cubic symmetry with lattice parameter a = 9.1719(1) Å. Figure S4 illustrates the crystal structure of Fe2–yCoyO3. Compared to the database, the highly hypothetical model is Fe2–yCoyO3 with Ia3 space group (2-Mn2O3 cubic bixbyite), which is composed of FeO6 and CoO6 octahedrons. The XRD pattern of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons (red curve in Figure 5a) displays the crystallinity combination of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons and Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires, suggesting the formation of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure. Furthermore, chemical composition and the content of each component were identified by XPS, as shown in Figure 5b–d. XPS is an ultrasensitive tool to detect surface properties of materials. XPS survey spectra in Figure 5b indicate the presence of Co, O, and C in both Co3O4–x-carbon and Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural samples. The presence of iron (red curve) confirms the existence of Fe2–yCoyO3 in the heterostructural sample. The isolated peak at 398 eV is ascribed to N 1s. The presence of N is attributed to the residue from decomposition of ZIF-67 at 600 °C. (29) Pyridinic N (401 eV) and quaternary N (308 eV) -related active sites can serve for OER activity (Figure S6). (4, 30, 31) The peaks at 230 and 167 eV are ascribed to S 2S and S 2p, respectively (Figure S6). The existence of S is ascribed to the residue of iron precursor Fe(SO4)2. High-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra of Co3O4–x-carbon and the heterostructural sample are given in Figure 5c,e, showing the peaks of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 at 780 and 796 eV, respectively. To further analyze the surface properties of the samples, high-resolution Co 2p spectra of both Co3O4–x-carbon and the heterostructural sample are fitted to study the electronic states of cobalt with different valences (Figures S7 and S8 and Tables S1 and S2). The two fitted peaks for Co 2p3/2 are Co3+ (778.7 eV) and Co2+ (778.9 eV), respectively. The relative atomic ratio of Co2+/Co3+ on the surface of Co3O4–x could be calculated through comparison of the areas covered by the fitted curves. It is calculated that the atomic ratio of Co2+/Co3+ (0.943) on Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons is higher than that on pure Co3O4 (0.736) (Figure S7), indicating that partial Co3+ ions are reduced into Co2+ during sintering in nitrogen; that is, surface oxygen vacancies are generated on the surface of Co3O4–x nanoparticles, which can be further confirmed by high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra. Figure S10 shows one oxygen peak contribution in the O 1s region from pure Co3O4, and Figure 5d presents three peak contributions in the O 1s region from the Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons. In Figure S10, the peak at 529.4 eV is for typical metal–oxygen bonds. In Figure 5d, the O3 at the higher value of 532 eV resulted from reduction of Co3O4 during sintering, which is ascribed to the high binding energy peak from surface oxygen defect species. The existence of the O3 peak indicates the presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface of Co3O4–x nanoparticles. Previous study of DFT calculations demonstrated that oxygen vacancies can introduce new defective states in the energy band gap of Co3O4 and two electrons on the defective states are excited, leading to enhancement of the electronic conductivity of Co3O4. (23, 24) Oxygen vacancies on the surface of Co3O4–x nanoparticles may enhance the electronic conductivity, provide more electrochemically active sites, and thus improve the electrocatalytic activity for OER.

Oxygen vacancies on the surface of Co3O4–x nanoparticles may not only contribute to conductivity but also serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites for the growth of Fe2–yCoyO3 crystals. Figure 5e shows the Co 2p XPS spectrum of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons. In order to obtain accurate Co(II) and Co(III) content, Auger intensity of Fe has been subtracted from the overall peak intensity according to the stoichiometry shown in Figure S11. The molar ratio of Co(II) to Co(III) in Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons is calculated to be 0.59, which is much lower than that of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons (0.94). (32) Moreover, the Fe 2p spectrum in Figure S12 and Fe 2p3/2 spectral fitting parameters in Table S3 confirm Fe(III) in Fe2–yCoyO3 compound. (32) The increasing content of Co(III) and the appearance of Fe(III) (Figure 5b and Figure S12) indicate the growth of Fe2–yCoyO3 crystals on the surface of polyhedrons. In addition, compared to the spin–orbit splitting between Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 in Figure 5c,e, Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure exhibits smaller peak separation than that of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons. On the basis of previous reports, (33-36) Co(II) usually shows larger spin–orbit separation of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 due to multiplet splitting effects, which are absent for Co(III). Within Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure, the Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires grown on the surface of Co3O4–x-carbon polyhedron contain rich Co(III); therefore, the multiplet splitting effects from Co(II) decrease, leading to decreased spin–orbit separation of 2p3/2 and 2p1/2. The growth process of Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires is suggested as the following: when the Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons are homogeneously dispersed in aqueous ferrous sulfate for 20 h, it is intriguing to find that Fe2+ ions are oxidized in water and slowly hydrolyze at room temperature, resulting in FeOOH and H+. The H+ ions can penetrate through amorphous carbon and react with partial Co3O4. Therefore, some Co3O4 nanoparticles are slowly dissolved. Afterward, the defect sites on Co3O4–x nanoparticles are essential to trap the diffusing FeO6 and CoO6 units. As a result, the Fe2–yCoyO3 nucleates on the surface of hollow polyhedrons and epitaxially grows into nanowires, forming the heterostructure. In contrast to our previous work, (23) the Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons in this method provide both nucleation sites and cobalt precursor for the growth of Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires with high crystallinity. To investigate the effect of oxygen vacancies on the growth of Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires, we also prepared Co3O4@amorphous FeOOH nanowires by dispersing pure Co3O4 without oxygen vacancies into an aqueous solution of ferrous sulfate for 20 h (the experimental procedure is described in detail in the Supporting Information). As we can see in Figures S13 and S14, without oxygen vacancies to serve as heterogeneous nucleation sites, FeOOH grows into amorphous nanowires via self-assembly, hydrolysis of Fe3+, and oxolation of FeO6 units. (28)
Electrocatalytic activity for OER of the as-prepared pure Co3O4, Co3O4–x hollow polyhedrons, and Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural samples is investigated by use of a typical three-electrode system in 1 M KOH solution (pH = 14). Potential is measured versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and presented versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Linear sweep voltammetric (LSV) curves are first measured for these OER catalysts, as displayed in Figure 6. The oxidization sweep curve of the Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons (Figure 6a, red curve) exhibits an onset potential as low as 1.52 V versus RHE, much lower than that of the Co3O4–x hollow polyhedrons (1.55 V, blue curve) and pure Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons (1.62 V, cyan curve). Furthermore, to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm2, pure Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons require a potential of 1.73 V versus RHE, while Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons require 1.63 V, and Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructures require only 1.58 V, suggesting an excellent electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructures for OER. At a potential of 1.70 V versus RHE, the Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure also exhibits an OER areal current density of 70 mA/cm2, which is much higher than those of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons (35 mA/cm2) and pure Co3O4 (5 mA/cm2) at the same potential. The OER kinetics of electrocatalysis is further analyzed by their related Tafel plots, based on the Tafel equation η = b log (j), where η is the overpotential, b is the Tafel slope, and j is the current density (Figure 6b). In Figure 6b, the Tafel slope of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure is calculated to be 37.6 mV/decade, much lower than those of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons (74.3 mV/decade) and pure Co3O4 (92.9 mV/decade). The lowest Tafel slope indicates fast catalytic reaction kinetics of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure. The improved OER performance of is attributed to the high surface area of the heterostructure as well as excellent electronic conductivity of the Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedron framework, which is further confirmed by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) results in Figure 6c. In order to investigate the OER kinetics occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces, EIS is used to measure the three samples (tested at 1.6 V vs RHE, Figure 6d). EIS technology, one of the most powerful tools for studying electrochemical kinetics, can be used to investigate the processes occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. In the Nyquist plot, charge-transfer resistance (Rct) is related to the electrocatalytic kinetics and its lower value corresponds to a faster reaction rate, which can be obtained from the semicircle in the low-frequency zone. The Rct value for Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure is about 8 Ω, which is much lower than those of Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedron (13 Ω) and pure Co3O4 nanocubes (51 Ω), suggesting the easiest electron transfer and, consequently, the most favorable OER kinetics at the interface. Moreover, to estimate durability, accelerated linear potential sweeps are conducted continuously for 6000 cycles on the Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure (Figure 6d). At the end of cycling, the catalyst shows similar polarization curves with a small shift of about 20 mV at j = 50 mA/cm2, exhibiting good stability in an alkaline environment. The loss of catalytic activity is attributed to slow catalyst dissolution during testing, which is commonly observed for Fe-based electrocatalysts. (25, 37, 38) In crystalline Fe2–yCoyO3, the CoO6 octahedrons act as a chemically stable host for Fe, improving the stability of Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires.

(d) Polarization curves of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons after 6000 cycles.
In addition, in comparison with most recently reported Co3O4-based electrocatalysts, our work demonstrates significantly lower onset potential and reduced Tafel slope. (39, 40) For example, Min and co-workers (40) reported that Co3O4 thin film exhibits an overpotential of 377 mV with the Tafel slope of 58.1 mV/decade. Moreover, Zhu and co-workers (41) synthesized ultrathin iron–cobalt nanosheets that show an overpotential of 350 mV at a specific current of 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 36.8 mV/decade. Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires are crucial for the enhanced catalytic activity. The role of Fe in Co-based material has been systematically studied in the work of Burke et al. (16, 25) On the basis of their conclusion, Co1–xFex(OOH) shows OER activity by ∼100-fold over that of pure CoOOH. Moreover, commercial RuO2/IrO2 sample usually exhibits an overpotential of 370–430 mV at 10 mA/cm2. (41, 42, 43) In contrast, our Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure exhibits an overpotential as low as 350 mV with a Tafel slope of only 37.6 mV/decade.
The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons is attributed to the following two reasons: First, the synergistic effect of Fe and Co in Fe2–yCoyO3 mixed phase boosts the electrocatalytic activity. Specifically, in Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires, Fe provides the main active sites due to higher activity than Co. (25) Furthermore, cobalt oxides provide high conductivity and a stable scaffold, and meanwhile iron oxides can be atomically dispersed, ensuring a large number of active sites for OER activity. Second, the synergistic effect between Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedron framework and integrated Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires further improves the catalytic activity. To be specific, the Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedrons not only act as a growth platform for Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires but also provide efficient electronic transportation. Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires, grown directly on the polyhedrons can promote the permeability of electrolyte and provide very high surface area and abundant edges.
Conclusion
In summary, Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons are rationally designed and fabricated via thermal treatment of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) followed by self-assembly growth of Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires. The as-prepared Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 sample displays unique heterostructure composed of interior Co3O4–x-carbon hollow polyhedron framework that is integrated with exterior tiny Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires. Due to their unique composition and architecture, Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructural hollow polyhedrons show significant improvements as a novel electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes. The enhanced performance is attributed to the intrinsic high catalytic activity of Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires and the unique heterostructural hollow nanostructure. The interconnected Co3O4–x-carbon polyhedron framework with oxygen vacancies provides abundant exposed active sites and efficient electronic transportation, and Fe2–yCoyO3 nanowires directly grown on the polyhedrons provide very high surface area and abundant edges. The resultant catalyst also demonstrates excellent durability during long-term cycling in the alkaline environment due to excellent stability of the Co3O4–x-carbon@Fe2–yCoyO3 heterostructure. Moreover, this material is prepared via a facile procedure from low-cost precursors, which can be easily extended to the preparation of other carbon-coated metal nitrides for a broad range of applications such as heterocatalysis, solar cells, and fuel cells.
