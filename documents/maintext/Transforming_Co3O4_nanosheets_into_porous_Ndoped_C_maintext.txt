Cobalt oxides have been widely investigated as promising replacements for noble metal-based catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we, for the first time, have obtained porous CoxOy nanosheets with N-doping and oxygen vacancies by etching Co3O4 nanosheets with NH3 plasma. Comparing with the pristine Co3O4 nanosheets (1.79 V), the porous CoxOy nanosheets with N-doping and oxygen vacancies have a much lower potential of 1.51 V versus RHE to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The obtained sample has a lower Tafel slope of 68 mV dec−1 than the pristine Co3O4 nanosheets (234 mV dec−1). The disclosed Co2+, which is responsible for the formation of active sites (CoOOH), N-doping and oxygen vacancies, gives rise to better performance of OER.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck of electrochemical water splitting because of the sluggish reaction kinetics
[1]
,
[2]
,
[3]
,
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
. To accelerate the reaction rate and reduce the overpotential, electrocatalysts were needed in OER. So far, the most active OER catalysts are noble metal oxides such as Iridium dioxide (IrO2) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO2)
[7]
,
[8]
. Nevertheless, these catalysts cannot be widely used due to their expensiveness and scarcity
[9]
,
[10]
. Alternatively, non-precious first-row transition metal alloys, oxides and hydroxides have exhibited promising electrocatalytic activity towards the OER
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
,
[15]
. Particularly, cobalt oxides (such as Co3O4, CoO) have attracted many attentions since their high activity, low cost and high stability
[16]
,
[17]
.
To improve the electrocatalytic activity of cobalt oxide for the OER, rational designed cobalt oxides with creating defects, increased surface area and improved conductivity have been developed
[18]
,
[19]
,
[20]
. For example, Chen et al. prepared a CoOx material by plasma etching a biopolymer-cobalt complex, and the enhanced catalytic performance was observed due to the amorphous structure and abundant defects
[18]
. Meanwhile, Sun et al. enhanced the electrocatalytic activity of CoO through confinement into mesoporous carbon
[19]
. Zhang et al. converted semi-conductive Co3O4 nanowire arrays into metallic cobalt nitride (CoN), resulting in high OER activity and good stability
[20]
. Hence, it is an efficient strategy for creating defects-rich and porous structure to improve the electrocatalytic activity of cobalt oxide.
Another useful strategy to enhance OER activities is oxygen vacancies and N-doping
[21]
,
[22]
,
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
,
[26]
. As early as 2015, Gao et al. had reported that oxygen vacancies in CoO could promote OER catalytic performance
[21]
. Later, Xu et al. designed Co3O4 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies by convenient plasma etching which showed the enhanced OER performance
[22]
. Until now, the oxygen vacancies become more controllable. For example, Xu et al. can control the concentration of oxygen vacancies by a ligand-assisted polyol reduction method and Cai et al. introduce vacancy defects into single-crystalline Co3O4 with given facets by NaOH etching
[23]
,
[24]
. Also, the enhancement caused by N-doping has been demonstrated by Zhang et al. and Chen et al.
[20]
,
[25]
.
According to above discussions, it is necessary to develop a strategy to simultaneously creating the porous structure, oxygen vacancies and heteroatom doping on cobalt oxide. Fortunately, plasma technology has been verified as a very facile and efficient approach to introduce the porous structure, oxygen vacancies and heteroatom doping to nanomaterials
[22]
,
[26]
. Plasma can etch the surface of catalysts leading to the formation of porous structure and oxygen vacancies
[15]
,
[18]
,
[22]
. Meanwhile, N-doping can be carried out using plasma containing nitrogen source such as N2 and NH3 plasma
[12]
,
[20]
.
In this work, we successfully transformed Co3O4 nanosheets to porous CoxOy nanosheets with N-doping and oxygen vacancies by NH3 plasma. Firstly, Co3O4 nanosheets were prepared as reported previously
[22]
. Then, the obtained Co3O4 nanosheets (CoxOy-0) were treated under NH3 plasma at the room temperature at the power of 300 W for different times, specifically 2 min, 5 min, 8 min and 12 min, which are named as CoxOy-2, CoxOy-5, CoxOy-8 and CoxOy-12, respectively. The as-obtained porous N-doped CoxOy nanosheets with oxygen vacancies (CoxOy-8) show a small Tafel slope of 68 mV dec−1, a good life-time in 0.1 M KOH and a low potential of 1.51 V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm−2. The strategy is clean, simple and efficient, which provides a novel way for simultaneously creating the porous structure, oxygen vacancies and heteroatom doping on transition metal oxides.
At the room temperature, the electrodeposition experiment was carried out in a three-electrode cell at −1.0 V (vs. SCE) using Ti foil (1 cm×1 cm) as the working electrode, a carbon rod as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and 0.05 M Co(NO3)2.6H2O as the aqueous electrolyte. After 10 min electrodeposition, a layer of Co(OH)2 was obtained on the Ti foil. The green Ti foil was rinsed with deionized water several times carefully and finally dried in air. Then the sample was calcined in air at the temperature of 250 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 and the Co3O4 nanosheets were obtained. The mass loading of Co3O4 on Ti foil was about 0.5 mg. The Co3O4 nanosheets array was treated by NH3 plasma (commercial 13.56 MHz RF source) with different irradiation times (0 min, 2 min, 5 min, 8 min and 12 min) with power of 300 W and pressure of 40 Pa. Also, we treated the Co3O4 nanosheets by NH3 plasma at the power of 200 W for the time of 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min and 20 min. In addition, commercial electrocatalysts, such as RuO2 and 20% Pt/C, were tested for OER under the same condition.
The morphology and microstructure of samples were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi, S-4800) and transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI, F20 S-TWIX). The crystal structures of samples were obtained using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX 2500 diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (BET) were measured on Micromeritics ASAP 2020 V3.02 H. The surface properties of electrocatalysts were performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Kratos Analytical Ltd. AXIS ULTRA).
All the electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) were performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760 E, CH Instrument) with a three-electrode system at the room temperature including a carbon rod, SCE, the obtained samples and 0.1 M KOH as the counter electrode, the reference electrode, the working electrode and the electrolyte, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) test of CoxOy-0 and CoxOy-8 were carried out with a potential of 0.5 V (vs. SCE) using an Autolab workstation (Autolab PGSTAT302N, Metrohm-Autolab BV, Netherlands). When the current was zero, the average value (0.99 V) of the two potentials was taken to be the thermodynamic potential for the hydrogen electrode reactions. So, it could be deduced with the equation: E (RHE) = E (SCE) + 0.99 V. All data were presented with IR correction.
Firstly, the composition and phase of these samples were studied by XRD.
Fig. 1
(a) shows that the peaks that belong to CoO start to emerge from Co3O4 matrix after etching by NH3 plasma. The CoxOy-5 is mainly indexed to the phase of Co3O4 (JCPDS file nos. 43-1003), indicating that the composition and phase do not change significantly after 5 min treatment of NH3 plasma. With the increase of the treatment time, the peaks of CoO (JCPDS file nos. 43-1004) gradually appeared. The pattern of the CoxOy-8 and CoxOy-12 sample shows the co-existence of the peaks for Co3O4 and CoO, indicating that the sample is a composite of CoO and Co3O4.
Fig. 1. (a) The XRD patterns, (b) N2 sorption isotherms and (c) Raman spectra of CoxOy-0 (0 min), CoxOy-2 (2 min), CoxOy-5 (5 min), CoxOy-8 (8 min) and CoxOy-12 (12 min).
Moreover, it can be seen that the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of CoxOy-8 (96.057 m2 g−1) is higher than that of CoxOy-0 (65.944 m2 g−1) in the
Fig. 1
(b), indicating more exposed activity sites for the electrocatalysis which is benefic for the performance of OER.
Raman spectroscopy was also applied to test the structural properties of the samples, as shown in
Fig. 1
(c). The spectrum of CoxOy-0 exhibits five Raman-active modes at about 194 cm−1 (F2g), 476 cm−1 (Eg), 518 cm−1 (F2g), 616 cm−1 (F2g) and 672 cm−1 (A1g), confirming the formation of cubic phase of Co3O4
[27]
. However, the NH3 treatment causes a shift and a smaller long-range and short-range order in the Raman spectra of CoxOy-2, CoxOy-5, CoxOy-8, and CoxOy-12, suggesting the existence of equally distributed defected sites
[28]
.
The morphologies of the Co3O4 nanosheets at different etching stages of NH3 plasma were observed by SEM (
Fig. 2
). Compared with the pristine Co3O4 nanosheets (
Fig. 2
(a)), there is no significant change in the morphologies after 2 min treatment by NH3 plasma, as shown in Fig. S1(a). With the increase of treatment time, there is a slight change including aggregation, unsmooth and discontinuous and porous surface of nanosheets after 5 min etched by NH3 plasma (Fig. S1(b)). After 8 min treatment, the nanosheets become granulation, twisted and discontinuous obviously (
Fig. 2
(b)). However, as can be seen in the Fig. S1(c), the Co3O4 nanosheets have been aggregated and etched severely after 12 min treated by NH3 plasma. The TEM was also used to measure the morphologies of CoxOy-0 and CoxOy-8. After 8 min treatment of NH3 plasma, the solid Co3O4 nanosheets (
Fig. 2
(c)) convert to porous nanosheets (
Fig. 2
(d)), which is consistent with the SEM images. In order to further study the microstructures of CoxOy-8 nanosheets, the HRTEM images and elemental mappings are collected. The lattice fringes of 0.24 and 0.21 nm confirmed from
Fig. 2
(e) can be indexed to (111) and (200) planes of the CoO nanosheets, which indicated that the pristine Co3O4 nanosheets were partly converted to CoO nanosheets after 8 min etched by NH3 plasma. It is shown that the elements of Co, O, N were uniformly distributed in the sample of CoxOy-8 nanosheets (
Fig. 2
(f)), indicating the introduction of N atom in the CoxOy-8 sample. TEM-EDX of CoxOy-8 nanosheets was shown in Fig. S3 and the concentration of N is around 3.85 at% (Table S1).

Meanwhile, the SEM images of Co3O4 nanosheets etched by NH3 plasma at the power of 200 W for the time of 5 min, 10 min, 15 min and 20 min were shown in Fig. S2. Compared with the pristine Co3O4, there is no obviously difference between the four samples in SEM images, indicating that the power of plasma is an important parameter to create the porous structure.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a common tool to characterize the surface properties of electrocatalysts
[29]
,
[30]
. The surface properties, including the elements component, surface chemical states and the content of each state are crucial for electrocatalysts. Thus, XPS was used to study the CoxOy-0 and CoxOy-8 samples. The signals of Co, O and C in the position of 780.15 eV, 532.3 eV and 284.8 eV are presented in the XPS survey of CoxOy-0 and CoxOy-8 nanosheets, but the signal of N (399.4 eV) only appears in the XPS survey of CoxOy-8 nanosheets, implying that the nitrogen atom is introduced in the lattice of CoxOy-8 nanosheets successfully (
Fig. 3
(a)). According to the literatures, the peak of 399.4 eV in the N 1s is attributed to the structure of Co-Nx, which further proves that N is doped into CoxOy-8 nanosheets, as shown in
Fig. 3
(b)
[31]
,
[32]
,
[33]
. As shown in
Fig. 3
(c), the peaks of 779.6 eV and 781.0 eV which fit to Co3+ and Co2+ were observed in the high resolution Co 2p spectrum of CoxOy-0 nanosheets. However, the peaks of Co3+ cannot be observed in the high resolution of Co 2p spectra of CoxOy-8 nanosheets and a new peak of 782 eV (Co-Nx) appears, implying that the Co3+ ions were converted to Co2+ completely and N is doped to CoxOy-8 nanosheets
[11]
. Moreover, compared to the CoxOy-0 nanosheets, there are two new satellite peaks fit to 787.7 eV and 804.8 eV in the CoxOy-8 nanosheets, suggesting that Co3+ ions were reduced to Co2+ and formed oxygen vacancies according to previous reports
[34]
. The reduction from Co3+ to Co2+ resulted from the plasma treatment, since plasma treatment has been used to reduce metal ions to metal nanoparticles, indicating its reducing capability
[35]
.
Fig. 3
(d) shows O 1s spectra of CoxOy-0 nanosheets and CoxOy-8 nanosheets. The peak of O1 (529.8 eV) represents the O2− in the crystal lattice of Co3O4 or CoO. Compared to the O1 peak intensity of CoxOy-0 nanosheets, the intensity of O1 peak decreases in the CoxOy-8 nanosheets significantly, indicating the introduction of N atom in the lattice of CoO and the formation of oxygen vacancies
[22]
. The peak of O2 at approximately 531.5 eV and O3 at the 532.2 eV can be associated with a hydroxyl group (OH−) and H2O, respectively
[36]
,
[37]
. O4 at the higher value of 532 eV resulted from Co3O4 reduction by NH3 plasma attributed to the high binding energy peak from surface oxygen defect species
[16]
,
[37]
. The appearance of the O4 peak in the O 1s region of the CoxOy-8 indicates the presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface of CoO
[38]
,
[39]
,
[40]
. According to the area percentage of O4 in O 1s spectrum, the concentration of oxygen vacancy can be calculated, which is 33 at%. Therefore, the XPS analysis further indicates the mixed phase of CoO and Co3O4, the existence of oxygen vacancies and N doping in CoxOy-8 nanosheets.

Fig. 4
shows the electrocatalytic activities of CoxOy-0 and CoxOy-8 nanosheets in the 0.1 M KOH solution. The LSV curves of CoxOy-0 and CoxOy-8 were shown in
Fig. 4
(a). It can be seen that the CoxOy-8 nanosheets show a better OER performance than the CoxOy-0 nanosheets. The CoxOy-8 nanosheets have an extremely low potential of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm−2 which is lower than that of CoxOy-0 nanosheets (1.79 V). Besides, the onset potential of the CoxOy-8 nanosheets is lower than that of the CoxOy-0 nanosheets. As listed in
Table 1
, the catalytic performance of CoxOy-8 is prior to most reported Co-based OER catalysts. The N-doping and oxygen vacancies are the primary factors improving the activities of OER on the CoxOy-8 nanosheets. The normalized LSV curves by the BET surface area are shown in the
Fig. 4
(b), showing that the OER performance of CoxOy-8 nanosheets is better than that of the CoxOy-0 nanosheets which exclude the contribution of the increased surface area (
Fig. 1
(b)) to the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity of CoxOy-8 nanosheets for OER. It is explained that the best catalytic activity of the CoxOy-8 nanosheets was contributed by the surface oxygen vacancies and N-doping. As shown in
Fig. 4
(c), the Tafel slope of the CoxOy-8 (68 mV dec−1) is small than that of CoxOy-0 (234 mV dec−1), indicating that CoxOy-8 has faster reaction rate constant and better electrocatalytic kinetics
[41]
. Fig. S4 shows the polarization and Tafel plots of CoxOy-0, CoxOy-2, CoxOy-5, CoxOy-8, CoxOy-12, RuO2 and Pt/C in control experiments. Besides, the polarization curves and Tafel plots of NH3 plasma treated Co3O4 nanosheets for 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 15 min and 20 min at the power of 200 W were exhibit in the Fig. S4(c) and (d). The CoxOy-8 sample shows the optimal catalytic performance in these five samples, while the performances of the other mix phase sample are unsatisfying. According to the reported work which demonstrated a thin CoO layer coated Co3O4 can show excellent OER performance
[52]
, a mix phase can cause an enhanced performance. However, unlike the continuous and uniform layer of CoO, the structure of CoO in this work is more complicated. Thus, not each mixed phase CoO and Co3O4 sample shows desired OER performance, and only the CoxOy-8 sample gives a superior OER activity.

Table 1. The comparison of OER performance of CoxOy-8 nanosheets with other OER electrocatalysts.
In addition, the turnover frequency (TOF) is also a very important kinetic parameter for OER. TOF is the intrinsic properties of the catalysts, which is important for evaluating the performance of the catalysts. As summarized in the
Table 2
, the TOF of CoxOy-8 is 0.012 s−1 at the potential of 1.5 V, while the TOF of the pristine Co3O4 is 0.00039 s−1.
Table 2. The turnover frequency (TOF) of CoxOy-0 and CoxOy-8.
To evaluate the stability of CoxOy-8 nanosheets for the OER in 0.1 M KOH, we tested the life-time of CoxOy-8 nanosheets by taking cyclic voltammograms for 2000 cycles at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (
Fig. 4
(d)). The LSV curves of CoxOy-8 after 2000 cycles are similar with that of the initial one, indicating the good stability of the obtained sample. Meanwhile, the atomic percentage of N in the sample before stability test which calculated from the XPS results is 2.7 at% and that of the sample after the stability test is 1.87%. The nitrogen was existed as Co–N bond in the sample before and after the stability test as shown in Fig. S7.
Fig. 4
(e) shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) which is performed to evaluate the electrode reaction kinetics of CoxOy-0 and CoxOy-8 nanosheets at the potential of 1.5 V. In the Fig. S5, CoxOy-8 nanosheets exhibit a much smaller charge transfer resistance (3.37 Ω) than CoxOy-0 nanosheets (13.3 Ω), suggesting that CoxOy-8 nanosheets have a much faster electron transfer than CoxOy-0 nanosheets. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) which are tested in the potential of 1.14–1.24 V at the scan rate of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mV s−1 are used to calculate the electrochemical surface area (ECSA). As shown in the Fig. S6, the double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the CoxOy-8 nanosheets is larger than that of the CoxOy-0 nanosheets, indicating that the CoxOy-8 nanosheets have more active sites than the CoxOy-0 nanosheets. Clearly, the employment of NH3 plasma treatment on Co3O4 nanosheets can turn their structures and properties and play significant roles for efficiently catalyzing the oxidation of water. Firstly, the NH3 plasma treatment can partly converse Co3O4 to CoO, which influences the relative population of Co2+ over Co3+. Meanwhile, previous studies on the facet-dependence of the Co3O4 for electrocatalysis have demonstrated that the population of Co2+ and Co3+ on different exposed facets of Co3O4 nanostructures is the key to influence the catalytic performance
[23]
,
[24]
. Moreover, Liu et al. performed the in-operando identification of geometrical-site dependent OER activity of spinel Co3O4 and concluded that Co2+ was the active sites for OER and Co2+ could promote the formation of cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as active sites for OER
[51]
. And Chen at al. proved the mix phase of CoO and Co3O4 has the superior catalytic performance
[52]
. Secondly, the NH3 plasma treatment can create oxygen vacancies and porous structures in the CoxOy-8 sample. Many reported works demonstrated oxygen vacancies and porous structures would enhance their catalytic performance since it can introduce higher surface area, more activity sites and better conductivity
[18]
,
[22]
,
[26]
. Thirdly, the NH3 plasmas treatment can dope N on the obtained samples. According to the literature, heteroatom doping is an important strategy to enhance OER activities of Co-based catalysts since the doping could alter the electronic density of the adjacent active atoms and form well-defined electronic configurations for adsorption of intermediates
[53]
.
In summary, for the first time, we have designed and prepared CoxOy nanosheets with N doping and oxygen vacancies by etching Co3O4 nanosheets with NH3 plasma. The electrocatalytic performance of CoxOy for OER is mainly improved by the increased surface area, N doping and formation of oxygen vacancies, which could be realized by the NH3 plasma etching simultaneously. Compared to the CoxOy-0 nanosheets, the catalytic activity of the CoxOy-8 nanosheets of OER has been largely improved. The CoxOy-8 nanosheets show good stability, low onset potential and low Tafel slope. The integration of N doping and oxygen vacancies into the CoxOy-8 nanosheets and their synergetic effect on the kinetics of OER should be responsible for the large enhancement of the electrochemical performances of the CoxOy-8 catalyst. The NH3 plasma-etching method is green, safe, simple and efficient. Therefore, this strategy also provides some new insights for us to design the high efficient catalysts for OER through heteroatoms doping and producing oxygen vacancies.
