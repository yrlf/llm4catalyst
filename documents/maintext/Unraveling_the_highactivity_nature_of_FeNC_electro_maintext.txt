{'Abstract': 'The scarcity and weak durability of precious metal catalysts are among the biggest obstacles to achieving cost-effective electrocatalysts in fuel cells and metal–air batteries. Hence, it is imperative to develop low-cost non-precious metal catalysts with comparable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity to precious metal catalysts. Herein, we report a highly effective strategy for the facile synthesis of Fe/N-functionalized 3D porous carbon networks. A major advantage of the newly designed catalyst is that ultrafine Fe4N nanoparticles are grown and uniformly mounted on the carbon framework upon pyrolysis treatment at 800 °C, and co-exist with numerous in situ formed Fe–N4 moieties in the carbon matrix, being evidenced by using X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy. The new electrocatalysts exhibit high ORR activity, comparable/superior to that of the state-of-the-art Fe/N–carbon based catalysts reported to date. Specifically, the catalysts show a half-wave potential of 0.890 V (vs. RHE) and a limited current density of 6.18 mA cm−2. By resorting to experimental measurements and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, the synergistic effects between Fe–N4 moieties and the Fe4N support are identified for the first time, which play a key role in boosting the catalytic performance of the Fe/N-functionalized porous carbon networks.', 'Introduction': 'In most Fe–N–C catalysts, Fe–N4 moieties are considered as the active sites to mainly contribute the ORR performance.9,10 However, during the synthesis, high-temperature pyrolysis treatment is normally required for the formation of Fe–N4 moieties, for which less active and large Fe-containing particles can easily precipitate.11,12 Hence, much effort has been devoted to making the structure of Fe–N–C catalysts as ideal as possible. One such ideal structure is the so-called single-metal atom catalysts (SACs) with the maximum utilization of all active metal sites.13–15 However, acid treatment is usually involved in the synthesis process to etch Fe-containing nanoparticles, which in turn corrodes the catalytic sites as well.13,15,16 Surprisingly, it has been recently found that certain Fe-containing nanoparticles can actually contribute high ORR activity, such as specially designed Fe–N–C catalysts with ultra-fine Fe-containing nanoparticles whose activity can be even higher than that of SACs.17–19 Naturally, open questions arise, for example: (1) why can the ultra-fine Fe-containing nanoparticles boost the ORR activity? (2) What is the exact molecular structure in the nanoparticle that really plays the key role in the catalysis? To address these questions, rational design and structure-controllable synthesis are developed to achieve high-performance Fe–N–C catalysts, while combined experimental and theoretical analysis can be utilized to gain deeper molecular-level insights into the underlying catalytic mechanism with the newly designed Fe–N–C catalysts.15,20\nHere, we report a new design of three-dimensional (3D) porous N-doped carbon networks with evenly distributed Fe-containing nanocrystals (named FeNCNs) as a high-performance catalyst towards the ORR. The electrochemical evaluation shows high electrocatalytic activity for the ORR in alkaline media with high durability. Especially, a half-wave potential of 0.890 V (vs. RHE) is achieved, which is comparable/superior to that of most Fe/N-functionalized carbon catalysts reported to date (Table S1†). The remarkable electrocatalytic performance stems from the 3D porous architecture with not only numerous active sites for catalysis but also newly found synergistic effects between the Fe–N4 moieties and Fe4N support. The present fabrication of FeNCNs is facile using cheap and eco-friendly metals and materials, thereby meeting the requirements for large-scale fabrication and wide application.', 'Experimental and computational': 'Chemicals\nSynthesis\nCharacterization\nElectrochemical measurements\nThe four-electron selectivity of the catalyst was evaluated based on the peroxide yield, which is calculated based on the following equation:\n\nThe electron transfer number (n) was calculated from the following equation:\n\nThe ECSA was determined from the following equation:\n\nComputational', 'Results and discussion': 'The morphology of the as-prepared FeNCNs-800 was captured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 1a and c, the 3D porous but interconnected feature of FeNCNs-800 was observed. However, no identifiable nanoparticles were clearly seen. Enlarged SEM images as well as TEM images were further taken to explore the possible iron formation/configuration (Fig. 1b and d). Some ultrafine nanoparticles were homogeneously anchored on the walls (highlighted with white circles in Fig. 1b; for clearer observation, one could refer to the enlarged image shown in Fig. S1†) and the thickness of the walls was measured to be ca. 30 nm. From the enlarged TEM image (Fig. 1d), we clearly saw that numerous Fe-based nanoparticles, ranging from 5 to 7 nm (see the statistical size analysis in the inset of Fig. 1d), were uniformly anchored on the carbon walls. Since no agglomeration was observed, the nanoparticles were believed to be tightly anchored on the walls, and the strong binding force between them was evidenced by their robust feature (no nanoparticles fell off) even when undergoing fierce ultrasonic treatment during the TEM sample preparation process.25 Furthermore, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were taken, as shown in Fig. 1e and f. The interplanar distances of the lattice fringes were measured to be 0.20 and 0.22 nm, and the corresponding lattice planes can be assigned to the (110) plane of Fe and the (111) plane of Fe4N, respectively. Notably, the uniform distribution of the nanoparticles allows more efficient mass transfer, which in turn may boost the ORR performance. Moreover, the HRTEM images also indicate that the carbon is composed of randomly disordered graphite-like planes (Fig. S2†).26 To further confirm that the nanoparticles are iron species, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping was performed (Fig. 1g). The C, N, O and Fe elements are demonstrated to be evenly dispersed over the entire sample. Therefore, the Fe and Fe4N species are uniformly distributed. EDS mapping with enlarged magnification was also conducted (Fig. S3†), which demonstrates that the Fe element signals mainly exist in the region of nanoparticles (black spots in Fig. S3†), confirming the fact that they are iron species.\nTo determine the crystalline feature of the catalysts, X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was undertaken. As shown in Fig. 2a, all diffraction peaks of FeNCNs-550 are well indexed to the standard diffraction pattern of Fe3O4 without any impurity peaks. The formation of Fe3O4 is attributed to the partial reduction of Fe from Fe3+ to Fe2+ by the π-electrons from the basal planes of carbon, consistent with previous studies.27 Meanwhile, the acid–base interaction between the acidic salt (Fe3Cl) and surface basic sites (provided by π-electrons in the basal planes of carbon and/or the attached oxygen-containing groups) can drive the motion of Fe3+ within the porous carbon, resulting in the formation of Fe3O4 on carbon walls.28 Upon raising the annealing temperature to 800 °C, Fe3O4 is reduced to metallic iron, while a new Fe4N phase arises due to the formation of new bonding between Fe and N. On further increasing the annealing temperature to 900 °C, no Fe4N characteristic peak is found, indicating that Fe4N is also reduced at this high temperature.\nAs for FeNC-800, the XRD pattern of FeNC-800 is similar to that of FeNCNs-800 (Fig. S4a†), suggesting that the involved chemical reaction is independent of NaCl templates. In the XRD pattern of other referential catalysts (NCNs-800 and acid-washed FeNCNs-800; Fig. S4a†), two broad diffraction peaks centered at 23.5° and 43.3° are observed, indexed to the (002) and (100) planes of turbostratic carbon.29 Apart from the broad carbon peak, the acid-washed FeNCNs-800 did not show any diffraction peaks related to crystalline Fe species, indicating that the acid-unstable Fe and Fe4N were effectively removed.30 To gain further insight into the chemical composition, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements for FeNCNs-550, FeNCNs-800, and FeNCNs-900 catalysts were carried out from room temperature to 800 °C, with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S4b†). The weight loss starting from ca. 400 °C should be associated with the combustion of the carbon component. Besides, the Fe species could be partially oxidized at the high temperature in an open air environment. Thus, the carbon contents of these samples should be higher than the mass loss (∼51%). From the curves shown in Fig. S4b,† we can also see that the remaining masses of the three samples are similar, after the TGA tests, indicating similar Fe contents in these samples. Note that a slight increase of the weight is observed at the end, due to the further oxidation of Fe species. In addition, the exact percentage of Fe in FeNCNs-Ts was measured by using ICP-MS (Table S2†), further confirming the similar Fe contents of these samples.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is further employed to analyze the major chemical bonding features in the as-prepared samples. The survey spectra of FeNCN-Ts and NCNs-800 are given in Fig. S5.†Fig. 2b shows the core level N 1s spectra of all the as-prepared samples, where for samples NCNs-800 and FeNCNs-550, four peaks centered at ∼398.3, ∼399.8, ∼400.8 and ∼402.7 eV are resolved and assigned to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidized N, respectively. Interestingly, an external peak located at ∼399.0 eV is observed for the samples of FeNCNs-800 and FeNCNs-900, which seems also related to Fe–N bonding due possibly to the formation of Fe–N4 moieties and/or Fe4N during the high-temperature pyrolysis process.12,31,32 Note also that the content of Fe–N was significantly reduced from 0.44 at% (FeNCNs-800) to 0.15 at% (FeNCNs-900) upon raising the pyrolysis temperature from 800 °C to 900 °C,33 as the Fe species (including Fe4N) can be further reduced by the π-electrons in the carbon basal planes (due to the reductive nature of carbon). The decomposition of Fe4N is further corroborated by the similar Fe–N contents (0.15 at% and 0.14 at%) and catalytic activities of FeNCNs-900 and acid-washed FeNCNs-800 (Fe4N was removed from both of them; see Fig. S6†). As for acid-washed FeNCNs-800, after removing the acid-unstable Fe-species including Fe4N, the Fe–N bonding only involves Fe–N4 configurations (the acid-resistant ones).30 Similarly, the Fe–N bonding in FeNCNs-900 should be associated with the Fe–N4 moieties only due to the decomposition of Fe4N at high temperature. These inferences are consistent with the fact that the Fe–N content of acid-washed FeNCNs-800 is much lower than that of FeNCNs-800 but similar to that of FeNCNs-900. In addition, as the pyrolysis temperature increased to 900 °C, some pyridinic N and pyrrolic N converted to graphitic N and oxidized N (Fig. 2b). Among these N species, pyridinic N was considered as the most efficient active site;34 however the activity of FeNCNs-800 with a lower content of pyridinic N exhibited the best activity, suggesting that the N-doping was not the dominant factor to determine the performance.\nRaman spectroscopy was also employed to corroborate the quality of the carbon networks that are subjected to different pyrolysis temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2c, two typical peaks located at ca. 1352 and 1594 cm−1 were identified, corresponding to the D-band (based on defect-mediated phonons near the Brillouin zone edges) and G-band (related to sp2 in plane phonon vibrations) of graphite, respectively. Generally, the relative intensity ratio of the D-band and G-band (ID/IG) reflects the disordered feature of carbon materials.35,36 On increasing the pyrolysis temperature of FeNCNs from 550 °C to 900 °C, the ID/IG ratio is increased from 0.95 to 1.04, indicating that more defects are introduced and numerous pores are generated at the higher temperature.37\nFor further evaluation of the iron speciation, 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, which is a powerful and iron-specific spectroscopic method, was carried out. In Fig. 2d, the Mössbauer spectrum was fitted with one sextet, one doublet, and another associated eight sub-peaks (the parameters are given in Table S3†). The doublet is assigned to square-planar Fe–N4, which is commonly recognized as the active site for the ORR in Fe–N–C catalysts.38,39 The sextet is generally assigned to α-Fe, while the associated eight sub-peaks are in agreement with those of Fe4N.40–43 In general, the Mössbauer spectrum of Fe4N is an aggregation of three sextets.42 Nevertheless, only the overall spectrum is presented to gain better resolution. Quantitative analysis from the 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum results revealed that the content of Fe–N4, α-Fe and Fe4N is 16.6%, 46.1% and 37.3%, respectively (Table S3†). Notably, this Mössbauer spectroscopy result is mostly in line with the synchrotron radiation data. The evolution of the local and electronic structure of Fe species was further investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. Reference samples, i.e. Fe foil, Fe3O4 and FePc, were also measured for comparison. As shown in Fig. S7,† both XANES and EXAFS curves of FeNCNs-550 are nearly identical to that of the Fe3O4 reference, suggesting that the Fe in FeNCNs-550 exists only in the form of Fe3O4 without any other species such as metallic Fe, Fe4N or Fe–N4 moieties. With the annealing temperature rising, from Fig. 2e, we can find that the Fe K-edge XANES has a negative shift, which is correlated with the effective reduction of Fe3O4. The XANES spectra of the Fe K-edge in Fig. 2e also show the similarity of pre-edge characteristics at ∼7114 eV among FeNCNs-800, FeNCNs-900 and FePc spectra, which is the fingerprint of the square-planar Fe–N4 moiety (D4h symmetry), suggesting that FeNCNs-800 and FeNCNs-900 have an Fe–N4 planar structure, despite the change of peak intensity.44,45 As shown in Fig. 2f, the Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra reveal well-matched peaks at ∼1.6 Å between FeNCNs-800, FeNCNs-900 and FePc, further confirming the presence of Fe–N4 moieties in those as-prepared catalysts.46 Besides Fe–N4 moieties, the peak at ∼1.6 Å in the EXAFS spectrum of FeNCNs-800 should also be assigned to iron nitride.47 However, according to the aforementioned characterization results, we believe that the existence of iron oxides was less possible, although the Fe–N and Fe–O bonds are undistinguishable in the EXAFS spectrum.16 The peaks at ∼2.2 Å and ∼4.4 Å are generally assigned to Fe–Fe in Fe metal.40,48 According to the atomic configuration of Fe4N, we find that the length of Fe–Fe in Fe4N is different from that in Fe metal. From the EXAFS measurement of FeNCNs-800, a peak at ∼2.7 Å can be discerned, which should be assigned to Fe–Fe in Fe4N. Comparing the EXAFS spectra of FeNCNs-800 and FeNCNs-900, we can clearly see that as the annealing temperature rises, the Fe–N interaction and Fe–Fe interaction in Fe4N become weaker, while the Fe–Fe interaction in metal Fe becomes stronger, confirming the reduction of Fe4N to Fe metal. In addition, the existence of Fe–N bonds in FeNCNs-900 proved the thermal stability of Fe–N4 moieties.\nN2 adsorption/desorption measurement is implemented to evaluate the porous features of the as-prepared samples (Fig. S8a and b and Table S4†). For the catalysts FeNCNs-800 and NCNs-800, interestingly, it is disclosed that upon Fe functionalization, FeNCNs-800 exhibits a much larger surface area and pore volume, due likely to the formation of the macroplanar architecture, namely the four-coordinated Fe complex.49 Conversely, the catalyst exhibits a low surface area and small pore volume if no NaCl template is used (Fig. S8c and d†). Among catalysts FeNCNs-550, FeNCNs-800 and FeNCNs-900, FeNCNs-800 has the largest surface area (532.78 m2 g−1) along with the largest pore volume (0.622 cm3 g−1). This is because Fe atoms do not have enough energy to bond with carbon or nitrogen at the temperature of 550 °C. However, they can easily bond with C/N by breaking the carbon lattice when the temperature is increased to 800 °C, resulting in voids and/or formation of Fe–N bonds, which in turn enlarge the surface area and pore volume. Furthermore, the recurring relatively small surface area and pore volume with further increasing temperature are possibly due to the partial shrinkage of the carbon skeleton at the higher temperature.50–52\nFig. 3a shows the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results of all catalysts, including commercially utilized Johnson Matthey Pt/C (20% Pt loading) at a rotating rate of 1600 rpm in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. Since high temperature is theoretically necessary to form an Fe–N structure for optimized ORR dynamics, FeNCNs-550 annealed at 550 °C yields the lowest current density and the smallest half-wave potential among all the catalysts with 3D networks, although it has the highest graphitization degree, which favours electron transfer, evidencing that the Fe3O4/N-doped carbon composite has little catalytic capability towards the ORR.53–55 The higher electrocatalytic activity of NCNs-800 is consistent with the previous report that the N atoms with high electronegativity favour polarization of the adjacent C atoms, serving as active sites.56 As for FeNC-800, although it has similar components to FeNCNs-800 and possesses a comparable specific surface area (confirmed from the carbonization of the freeze-dried organic), it exhibits much worse performance (in comparison with FeNCNs-800). Thus we can conclude that the NaCl template plays an important role. Without the template, the metal salt would be severely agglomerated during the freeze-drying process. Thus, after the carbonization, the metal active sites cannot be evenly distributed and fully exposed, and no network was formed as well (Fig. S8c†). Compared with NCNs-800, the performance of FeNCNs-800 is greatly improved after the introduction of iron, as measured from the positively shifted half-wave potential (E1/2) at 0.890 V and higher limited current density at 6.18 mA cm−2. Both parameters are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C and most efficient Fe/N-based carbon catalysts reported to date (Fig. 3b and Table S1†). Accordingly, the onset potential (Eonset) of FeNCNs-800 (0.985 V) is similar to that of commercial Pt/C (0.990 V) while is much more positive than that of others. In addition, as shown in Fig. S9,† the acidic ORR activity of these as-prepared samples followed the same trend as that in the alkaline electrolyte (FeNCNs-550 < NCNs-800 < FeNCNs-900 < FeNCNs-800). The high ORR activity of FeNCNs-800 is further evidenced by its small Tafel slope of 66 mV per decade (Fig. S10†). However, it is noteworthy that when the pyrolysis temperature is further raised, the activity of FeNCNs-900 is slightly attenuated. The results of more LSV measurements at different rotation rates are given in Fig. S11a–c.†\nCyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of FeNCNs-800, FeNCNs-900 and NCNs-800 catalysts are also conducted in O2-/Ar-saturated 0.1 M KOH, as shown in Fig. 3c. All the catalysts display well-defined cathodic peaks in the O2-saturated electrolyte, while no peak is observed with the Ar-saturated electrolyte. Among the three CV curves measured in O2-saturated electrolytes, FeNCNs-800 displays the most positive onset potential and highest cathodic current density, implying its higher ORR activity. Furthermore, the reaction kinetics is unveiled by RRDE measurement (Fig. S11d†). The peroxide yield (%) and the electron transfer number (n) are depicted in Fig. 3d. The peroxide yield of FeNCNs-800 is less than 10% and the electron transfer number is 3.9 (close to four) over the potential range from 0.2 to 0.9 V, indicating that the ORR reaction on FeNCNs-800 follows a four-electron (4e−) route similar to the Pt/C case. By comparison, the reaction kinetics of FeNCNs-900 and acid-washed FeNCNs-800 are found to be similar to that of FeNCNs-800, although their electron-transfer numbers are a bit less than that of FeNCNs-800. For the NCNs-800 catalyst, it involves a considerable two-electron process besides the 4e− pathway. Hence, we conclude that the introduction of iron is essential to facilitating the 4e− pathway.\nTo assess the electrochemical durability of FeNCNs-800 and monitor the methanol crossover effect, chronoamperometric measurements are performed in O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution at 0.7 V with a rotation rate of 1600 rpm. As shown in Fig. 3e, FeNCNs-800 displays 91.2% current density retention over 10 h continuous working, which is better than commercial Pt/C (82.6% retention) under the same measurement conditions. This good durability is possibly due to the well configured and robust 3D networks (Fig. S12†). After 5 mL methanol is injected into O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH, no significant current change is observed except for a slight oscillation (Fig. 3f), suggesting a strong tolerance against methanol poisoning. In stark contrast, the current density of commercial Pt/C decreases dramatically. More CVs and ORR polarization behaviors, upon methanol poisoning, are shown in Fig. S13.† In addition, to evaluate the potential application of FeNCNs-800, the mass activity (Jm) was calculated via the normalization of kinetic current (Jk) with the mass loading, where Jk was calculated by using the K–L equation . As shown in Fig. S14,† the kinetic mass current of FeNCNs-800 at 0.9 V is similar to that of commercial Pt/C, indicating its potential applications in energy conversion devices.\nSeveral special features contribute to the high activity of Fe–N–C catalysts toward the ORR. First, the 3D porous networks are important for providing highly accessible active sites and facilitating mass transfer.57 As shown in Fig. S15,† the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of FeNCNs-800, FeNCNs-900 and FeNC-800 was determined to be 159, 112 and 16 cm2, respectively, validating that the samples with 3D structures can expose much more active sites.58 Secondly, NCNs-800 (without Fe functionalization) is not comparable to FeNCNs-800, confirming that the introduction of Fe species remarkably improves the activity. To have a better understanding on why the introduced iron improves the catalytic performance, the electrochemical evaluation is carried out for the catalysts at different temperatures. The results confirm that FeNCNs-800 containing Fe–N4 moieties, Fe4N and Fe exhibits the strongest catalytic behaviour. As mentioned before, the poor activity of FeNCNs-550 is attributed to the low pyrolysis temperature, which cannot allow the formation of the active Fe–N structure. However, compared with FeNCNs-800, the higher temperature synthesis also results in the dramatic loss of performance (FeNCNs-900). Since the slightly lower graphitization degree mainly influences the limited current density,19,59,60 we suppose that the unique Fe4N existing in FeNCNs-800 also plays an important role, and the degradation of catalytic performance should be attributed to the loss of Fe4N, in addition to the decrease of the graphitization degree.\nAnother control sample (acid-washed FeNCNs-800) is also prepared to gain further insight. XRD patterns confirm that no crystalline iron is retained after acid washing (Fig. S4a†). However, we notice that the E1/2 is negatively shifted by 44 mV compared with that of fresh FeNCNs-800, but is still notably higher than that of NCNs-800 (Fig. S16†). Thus, we conclude that the acid-resistant Fe–N4 moiety is one kind of active centre, which has also been verified in our recent work, and the Fe-based nanoparticles can be a co-contributor as well.10 From the XPS measurement of FeNCNs-900 and acid-washed FeNCNs-800 (Fig. S6a†), it can be seen that the Fe–N contents in the two samples are nearly the same. As mentioned before, the Fe–N bonding in both FeNCNs-900 and acid-washed FeNCNs-800 was attributed to the acid-endurable Fe–N4 configuration.30 Thus the main difference between the two samples is whether they contain metallic Fe particles, and the slight performance improvement for the ORR (Fig. S6b†), verifying that the extra Fe nanoparticles in FeNCNs-900 did not have a very significant effect on performance compared with the Fe species in FeNCNs-800, which also proved the effect of Fe4N from a different angle.\nTo understand the high ORR activity of FeNCNs-800, we also perform a theoretical study based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compare with the experimental results. Here, a series of FeNCN models, e.g. Fe4N(001)–N supported Fe–N4, Fe4N(001)–Fe supported Fe–N4, Fe4N(111)–Fe supported Fe–N4 and Fe4N(111)–FeN supported Fe–N4, are considered. The optimized structures are presented in Fig. S17–S20.† It is known that for an ideal catalyst, the reaction free energies of all the four proton-transfer steps should be the same (4.92 V/4 = 1.23 V = U0RHE) at zero potential. Thus, in the present work, we compute the reaction free energy for each elementary step, in the four-electron ORR reaction mechanism, by which we can compare the catalytic activity of FeNCNs-800 with that of other model systems. The less the absolute deviation between the on-set potential UonsetRHE and equilibrium potential (U0RHE, 1.23 V), the higher the ORR electrocatalytic performance will be. The adsorption free energy of O*, OH*, and OOH* is given in Table S5.† The values of the entropy and zero-point energy corrections, both included in the calculation of the adsorption free energies, are listed in Table S6.† Fig. S21† shows the reaction free energy of each elementary step in the ORR process at zero potential, from which the UonsetRHE for the ORR is obtained. As shown in Table S7,† among the models considered, the Fe4N supported Fe–N4 moieties yield the highest ORR electrocatalytic performance. However, the pristine Fe4N itself exhibits little catalytic activity toward the ORR. Based on the theoretical computation and aforementioned experimental evidence, we conclude that the supported Fe4N is the dominant contributor to the high catalytic performance of FeNCNs.\nTo gain further insight into the effect of different Fe species, e.g., Fe, Fe3O4 and Fe4N, on catalytic activity for the ORR, we compute the partial density of states (PDOS) of the d orbitals of Fe atoms in these species (Fe, Fe3O4, and Fe4N) and p orbitals of C and N atoms in Fe–N4/graphene sheets. The d orbitals of Fe atoms play a pivotal role in adsorption. The electron accumulation and the increased hybridization region of the Fe-d, C-p and N-p states for the supported Fe–N4/graphene sheets confirm a distinct charge transfer behaviour (Fig. 4c), again supporting that the catalytic activity of FeNCNs-800 is mainly contributed by Fe4N.
