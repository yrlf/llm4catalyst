Introduction
Energy is important for the development of national economies and the improvement of human living standards, which are important factors directly affecting economic development. Since the beginning of the 21st century, the shortage of resources, environmental pollution, and greenhouse effect caused by traditional energy utilization methods have become more and more prominent, and it is increasingly difficult for the traditional energy structure and its utilization methods to meet the needs of human survival and development.1 To address the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental pollution problems, a variety of new green energy sources have been developed, including metal–air batteries and fuel cells.2
Given the urgent need for a sustainable energy economy, electrochemical energy conversion technologies, such as polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and metal–air batteries, have become extremely important. The common feature of PEMFCs and metal–air batteries is that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the basis for their operation. The electrolytes can be divided into acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Acidic electrolytes promote proton transfer from the anode to the cathode. In acidic electrolyte, ORR occurs by four- or two-electron reduction.3 The experimental results show that the four-electron reduction mechanism is dominant and advantageous, because each oxygen molecule has four electrons. This route can avoid the formation of hydrogen peroxide at the electrode, which results in degradation of the membrane and ionic monomer.4 In alkaline electrolytes, hydroxyl ion is transferred from cathode to anode. In metal–air batteries and alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells, the ORR process can also occur by two-step reduction (total of four electrons), in which hydrogen peroxide can be directly or indirectly reduced to water.
At present, platinum is the only commercial catalyst that shows high activity and stability under acidic conditions. Rapid oxygen reduction kinetics is indispensable in terms of performance. Acidic ORR is several orders of magnitude slower than anodic oxidation. Researchers found that ORR kinetics is more favorable under alkaline conditions. In the cathode reaction of the hydrogen fuel cell, the reduction of O2 to H2O requires four electrons and four protons.5 The mechanism of this process is very complicated, and ORR dynamics usually limits the reaction rate and maximum power. In recent years, nonmetal-doped graphene materials have gained much attention for ORR. The electrochemical activity and durability of these nonmetal-doped graphene materials can be compared with that of traditional platinum supported on carbon black (Pt/C).6 This is a breakthrough and a new milestone in the ORR, because it can substitute the expensive platinum and achieve appropriate power output.7
Graphene is a two-dimensional grid-structured material composed of planar single-layer carbon atoms. It is the basic unit of other carbon allotropes, such as fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphite. The theoretical specific surface area of graphene is as high as 2630 m2 g−1.4 It has excellent thermal conductivity and electronic conductivity and has a wide array of prospects for application. At the basic level, graphene is a chemically specific hexagonal pattern of single-layer sp2 carbon atoms.8 However, the zero-band-gap property of graphene decreases its catalytic activity.9 Unmodified graphene shows low electrocatalytic activity for the ORR and is not suitable for direct use as a cathode catalyst for fuel cells.2d The introduction of heteroatoms into graphene can modify its electronic and electrochemical properties by changing the electron density in the graphene sheet. Heteroatom-doped graphene can not only improve the electrical properties of graphene, but also create more sites for ORR.10 Theoretical and experimental results show that dopant heteroatoms in graphene sp2 orbitals can effectively change the electronic arrangement, generate active sites, and improve the catalytic activity.3b The dopant elements mainly include N, P, O, and S. N-doped graphene has been reported most frequently. In this Minireview, graphenes doped with different elements as nonmetallic ORR catalysts are discussed.
Synthetic Methods
Among the many methods for preparing nonmetal-doped graphene materials, the heteroatom doping process can be divided into in situ doping and post-processing methods. In situ doping is the process of introducing heteroatoms during graphene synthesis, and the whole process occurs simultaneously. To date, many preparation methods have been reported, which include chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma treatment, arc discharge, explosion, high-temperature heat treatment, and hydrothermal treatment.11 It is extremely difficult to remove the metal residues from some kinds of graphene, and this may significantly influence the catalytic performance.12 Herein, CVD and ball milling as in situ doping methods, as well as wet chemical methods, are discussed.
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) uses one or several vapor compounds or monomers to generate thin films by chemical reaction on the substrate surface. Its features include no need for high vacuum, gaseous reactants and byproducts, low-temperature and fast film precipitation, high crystallinity, compactness, and complete structure of the obtained film, good adhesion to the substrate, excellent step coverage, smooth deposition surface, broad scope of application of various metals, semiconductors, inorganic substances, and organic matter, controllable material stoichiometric ratio, batch production, and semicontinuous processing. As shown in Figure 1 a,13 solid, liquid, or gaseous precursors are added to the growth furnace together with carbon sources. However, the CVD method is expensive and is suitable for the synthesis of thin-film graphene but not for commercial large-scale production.14

Polymers containing heteroatoms (sometimes embedded in a polymer matrix) are deposited directly on metal catalysts. The whole process is safe without the use of high-temperature gas, and moderate doping can be achieved. Kwon et al.15 synthesized pyrrole monomers vaporized on copper substrates in the presence of Cu2+ ions, followed by CVD growth (Figure 1 b). The content of doped N is 3.14 %, and the mainly pyrrolic N may come from polypyrrole precursors. Sun et al.16 found that the amount of N doping reached 23.5 % when a mixture of nitrogen-rich melamine and poly(methyl methacrylate) was directly spin-coated on a copper substrate at 1000 °C and atmospheric pressure, whereby graphitic N occupies the main part of the N-doped structure and the charge-carrier mobility of N-doped graphene is low (<10 cm2 V−1 s−1).
Ball milling
Ball milling strips graphite and cracks C−C bonds, and the newly formed activated carbon species react with dopants through mechanochemistry. As an energy-saving and efficient material preparation technology, it can clearly reduce the activation energy of reactions, refine the grain size, greatly improve the activity of the powder, improve the uniformity of the particle size distribution and the interface between reinforcer and matrix, promote the diffusion of solid-state ions, induce low-temperature chemical reactions, and thus improve the compactness and electrical and thermal properties of materials. Zhang et al. prepared hydroxyl-functionalized graphene by ball milling.14a Jeon et al. studied graphene nanosheets as an efficient electronic catalyst for catalytic oxygen reduction. In ball milling, stainless steel balls are rotated at high speed to produce enough kinetic energy. As a result, 36 kinds of activated carbon were formed at the edges of crushed graphite. These activated carbons have enough reactivity to absorb halogens in sealed ball mill capsules.17 Similarly, marginally selective graphene halide nanoplatelets (XGnPs; X=Cl, Br, or I) were prepared by ball milling as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries.18
Wet chemical methods
Synthetic methods involving liquids and chemical reactions, such as coprecipitation, chemical bath deposition (CBD), electrochemical deposition (electroplating), and sol–gel processes, are collectively referred to as wet chemical methods. They have undergone rapid development in recent decades and are replacing some traditional ceramic fabrication methods. Due to small particle size, large specific surface area, and high chemical activity, ultrafine ceramic powders prepared by wet chemical methods have broad application prospects in heteroatom-doped carbon materials. The wet chemical method can be used to mix heteroatoms with 3D graphene gels having high surface area and porous structure.19 For example, Wu et al. employed ammonia boron trifluoride for codoping with B and N.19b Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) aerogels doped with B and N were prepared by freeze drying after reduction and self-assembly of GO sheets under hydrothermal conditions. Su et al. used N/S-codoped 3D graphene skeletons as efficient metal-free electrocatalysts for ORR under hydrothermal conditions.20
Graphene Doped with Different Nonmetals
Oxidized carbon materials
Graphene-based materials as substitutes for metal-based catalysts in energy catalysis have attracted wide attention owing to some superior properties. Oxidized carbon materials, that is, new nonmetal-based graphene catalysts, have begun to play a more and more important role in fuel cells. Lu et al. compared ORR performance on oxidized carbon materials and pure carbon materials and found that the oxidized carbon materials exhibited higher catalytic activity and selectivity to H2O2 for ORR in alkaline or neutral medium.21 The oxidized carbon materials can be obtained by chemical oxidation, in which functional groups containing oxygen atoms are generated. The oxidation process can contribute some defects to the regular fabric of carbon materials, which can change the electronic structure and further improve the ORR performance. Besides, the activity and selectivity are related to the oxygen content, and the active sites of ORR on the oxidized carbon materials are the carbon atoms neighboring the oxygen atoms in oxygen-containing functional groups.
Thus, the introduction of oxygen atoms can influence the electronic distribution owing to the higher electrophilicity of oxygen compared with carbon in the oxidized carbon materials. Consequently, the interaction between ORR intermediates and the active sites is changed. The existence of more active sites gives rise to rapid absorption of intermediates and further accelerates ORR.22 Therefore, the oxidized carbon materials are vital nonmetal-doped graphene catalysts in ORR fuel cells, which have great potential in practical applications.
Nitrogen-doped graphene
In recent years, researchers have developed low-cost nonmetallic carbon-based electrocatalysts for ORR.7a, 23 It is reported that zigzag carbon can offer active sites for catalyzing efficiently the ORR.24 The superior catalytic performance originates from the abundant defects of carbon. However, most of the pure carbon materials show relatively low ORR activity due to the absence of a band gap.25 To improve the catalytic activity, the N-doping strategy was introduced. To date, N-doped carbon materials have been widely used as ORR catalysts due to their excellent electrocatalytic activity, low cost, good stability, and environmental protection.10a, 26 The physical and chemical properties of N-doped graphene and undoped graphene are quite different. In the periodic table, nitrogen is adjacent to carbon. Because the electronegativity of N is higher than that of C, N atoms have the ability to attract more electrons and further change the electronic structure of graphene. It has been reported that N-doped graphene can be prepared from ammonia and graphene, and showed the best catalytic activity at 900 °C. The onset potential and half-wave potential of N-doped graphene were higher than those of industrial Pt/C catalyst.27 Gracia-Espino et al. prepared N-doped graphene by vapor deposition for ORR, which followed the “quasi-four-electron” reaction path.28 Zhao et al. synthesized an N-doped graphene material by pyrolysis of MOFs.29 Compared with pure graphene, the prepared doped graphene with high electroconductivity exhibits higher activity for ORR. Feng et al. used graphene oxide and NH4HCO3 as raw materials to prepare N-doped graphene. The degree of nitrogen doping reached 12.75 % at low temperature (150 °C), which is conducive to ORR.30 Xin et al. prepared a N-doped graphene by high-temperature heat treatment and found the type of nitrogen bonding has a significant effect on the selectivity and catalytic activity. Graphitic nitrogen determines the limiting current density, and pyridinic nitrogen the onset potential in the ORR.
The possible bonding of N-doped graphene is shown in Figure 2 a.31 There are three kinds of nitrogen bonding structures. Because the C−N bond length is essentially the same as the C−C bond length, pyridinic N and graphitic N have little effect on the structure of graphene.32 However, the sp3-bonded pyrrolic N destroys the planar structure of graphene. Pyridinic N has the best stability in the presence of a single vacancy. If Stone–Wells defects and vacancy defects occur, pyridinic N and graphitic N have greater influences on ORR.33 The higher electronegativity of N (3.04 on the Pauling scale) compared with C (2.55 on the Pauling scale) leads to polarization of the carbon network and thus affects the electrocatalytic performance of N-doped graphene.34 N-doped graphene can conduct electricity by inhibiting the density of states (DOS) near the band gap around the Dirac point (Figure 2 b).35 The conductive behavior of N-doped graphene also depends on the configuration. For graphitic N, three valence electrons of nitrogen form three σ bonds with adjacent carbon atoms, one electron participates in the formation of a π bond, and the fifth electron participates in the π* state of the junction band. Each graphitic N atom can contribute 0.5 electrons to the π network of the graphene lattice. For pyrrolidinic N, pyrrolidine forms at the defect sites and electrons can be extracted from graphene sheets into these defects, which results in an N-doping effect for the different bond types compared with pristine graphene (Figure 2 c).36 Paul et al. also pointed out that three chemical forms of nitrogen exist on the surface of N-doped graphene, namely pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N.26e Pyridinic N refers to nitrogen atoms attached to two carbon atoms, with corresponding X-ray photoelectron binding energies of 402–405 eV. In addition to supplying an electron to the conjugated bond system, the N atom also has a lone pair of electrons, which can absorb O2 molecules and their intermediates in the process of ORR, and thus improve the catalytic efficiency. Pyrrolic N is a nitrogen atom with two p electrons, conjugated with a π-bond system. Graphitic N refers to N atoms that are linked to three C atoms. Some researchers believe that graphitic N plays a key role in electrocatalytic ORR.37

It is also reported that the more graphitic N is contained in N-doped graphene, the better is its catalytic activity for the ORR. Pan et al. prepared N-doped graphene catalysts by pyrolysis at 800–1000 °C after mixing sugar and urea. The obtained materials show wrinkled multilayer graphene structure (Figures 3 a–c). The surface area can reach 565.1 m2 g−1 at 1000 °C. In 0.1 m KOH alkaline medium, the half-wave potential was 0.14 V versus Ag/AgCl, and Koutecky–Levich analysis determined that the N-doped graphene material had a good mass transfer limited current density at a potential of 0.25 V versus Ag/AgCl and that the electron-transfer number was 3.8.38

In addition, Ikeda et al. concluded that graphitic nitrogen is an energetically active site on the basis of the oxygen adsorption barrier and subsequent ORR process.39 Geng et al. found that the ORR activity of the N-doped graphene with 2.8 % N was high when the annealing temperature was 900 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the enhancement of ORR activity was attributable to the appropriate graphitization of N.11a Graphene oxide prepared by the Hummers method was used to synthesize N-doped graphene with a suitable nitrogen source. When the number of N atoms in pyrrole rings is large, polypyrrole can promote the electrochemical performance of graphene, which shows that it has excellent catalytic activity and is beneficial to the formation of water through the four-electron path in alkaline electrolyte. At the same time, the stability to natural gas and the cross-durability to methanol are also excellent. Its performance is superior to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst, which proves that graphitic N is very important in ORR.40 Zhen and co-workers used similar methods to explore the effect of graphitic N on ORR activity. The electrochemical tests showed that a more extensive graphitic nitrogen configuration might have better electrocatalytic ORR activity.41 Vazquez-Arenas and co-workers used DFT calculations to investigate the mechanism of ORR on N-doped graphene. It was proposed that the contact between a carbon atom and a graphitic N atom is an electronic defect that promotes the adsorption and reduction of oxygen through electron transfer in the reaction process, and thus plays the role of an active center.42
Moreover, researchers have suggested that pyridinic N is also a contributing factor to the electrocatalytic activity of ORR. Woo et al found that pyridinic N improved the ORR activity under acidic conditions.43 Xia et al. used argon as a protective gas to anneal melamine to prepare N-doped graphene. The results showed that the pyridine-N component determined the electrocatalytic activity of N-doped graphene in a redox reaction.44 Sun et al. developed a new method to prepare highly nitrogen doped platelet carbon nanofibers (plCNF). The chaotic edges of plCNFs are clipped by high-frequency etching technology, which produces many exposed edges and patterned edge points45 where the pyridinic N atoms are preferentially located. Electrochemical experiments showed that the carbon atoms near pyridinic N atoms can be used as catalytic centers for ORR, and the reaction is dominated by the four-electron process. The active sites on N-doped graphene can be determined from the changes in chemical composition before and after ORR. The activity of N-doped graphene is related to the chemisorption ability of OH groups, which are formed on the C atoms near pyridinic N atoms. The carbon atoms adjacent to pyridinic N play an important role in ORR and are the main active centers. Zhang et al. synthesized an N-doped carbon material from dried grass by adopting a novel green strategy without any starting chemicals, and the nitrogen bond has pyridinic-N structure.46 Recently, Zhao and co-workers found that the N-HC@G catalyst, in which the type of nitrogen is pyridinic N, has high ORR activity under both acid and alkaline conditions.47
Ruoff et al. reported that the content of graphitic N determines the limiting current density, while pyridinic nitrogen is the key to improving the electrocatalytic activity in ORR.48 To further clarify the catalytic mechanism, a series of simulations were carried out, and the energies on N-doped graphene with different degrees of doping were calculated by Boukhvalov and Son.49 When the amount of N doping is relatively low, the energy consumption in the intermediate process of ORR can be reduced and the energy barrier is lower than that on the platinum surface. The addition of nitrogen increases the positive spin density and charge density and enhances the catalytic activity.50 The process can occur spontaneously on N-doped graphene. Interestingly, the calculated average reversible potential is 1.15 V versus SHE, which is consistent with the experimental results (Figure 4). Meanwhile, multiple experiments revealed the influence of the position and microstructure of pyridinic N on its catalytic efficiency.51 A number of experiments have proved that ORR activity is related to the content of pyridinic N.10a, 44, 50a, 52

It has also been suggested that pyridinic N and graphitic N simultaneously influence ORR activity.48, 53 Wissam et al. found that pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen are the most active sites. Ten graphene quantum-dot models for simulating N-doped graphene were presented, six of which are shown in Figure 5.54 In models A, C, and D, nitrogen doping is similar to graphite substitution, whereby nitrogen is located at different distances from the edge of graphene quantum dots. Model B has similar pyridine-type doping. Pyridinic nitrogen is especially interesting because it has a pair of electrons besides one electron of the conjugated π bond. In model E, nitrogen belongs to pyrrolidine five-membered rings.55 Due to the mutual exclusion between nitrogen dopants, the aggregation of nitrogen on the original graphene is inhibited; therefore, the chemical properties of single-nitrogen doping are expected to be widely used.56

Kabir et al. prepared N-doped graphene films by a sacrificial-support method.57 The optimal doping temperature is 850 °C, which gave good ORR activity (Figure 6). The content of nitrogen components such as graphitic N, quaternary N, nitrogen hydride, and pyridinic N varies greatly with the pyrolysis temperature. The decrease of graphitic-N content and the increase of hydrogenation N/pyridinic N ratio would increase the ORR activity. The ORR mechanistic steps on graphitic, hydrogenation, and pyridinic nitrogen are proposed in Figure 6 c and d.57 Lu et al. prepared 3D N-doped graphene (3D-NG@SiO2).58 It was suggested that nitrogen mainly exists in the form of pyridinic N on pyrolysis of a poly(o-phenylenediamine)-containing nitrogen precursor and silica gel. The initial potential of 3D-NG@SiO2 was 0.08 V for ORR. The electron-transfer number was 3.92. This indicates that ORR on 3D-NG@SiO2 mainly occurs by the four-electron process. It was also shown that the catalyst has high activity, good durability, and broad application prospects.

Guo et al.59 clarified the possible mechanism of ORR on N-doped carbon materials by exploring the active sites of N-doped carbon materials for oxygen reduction. Lewis bases are formed by pyridinic N. First, oxygen molecules are adsorbed on carbon atoms next to the protonated pyridine N atoms. Two possible processes are proposed: one is the four-electron mechanism at a single site; the other is the 2+2 electron mechanism, which does not always occur at a single site. Mondal et al.60 synthesized N-doped graphene from heteroatomic polymers and proposed a mechanism of formation of N-doped graphene (Figure 7). When the material is treated at high temperature, chain breakage becomes active and low molecular weight fragments are produced. The products formed by chain breaking are usually free radicals, which combine with each other to form new products.61

Similar to N-doped graphene, N-doped carbon nanotubes have a larger specific surface area, higher conductivity, and excellent catalytic activity for the ORR.62 Moreover, their low cost, high activity, and excellent durability are advantages as a new electrocatalytic system for ORR.10d, 37, 52a, 63 Hybrid composites of N-doped graphene and N-doped carbon nanotubes (NGCA) have been obtained by the in situ synthesis method, which can further improve the catalytic performance for ORR.64 The N-doped carbon nanotubes can not only be used as a high-speed electron conduction channels, but also effectively prevent restacking of graphene and greatly improve the specific surface area and conductivity of NGCA composite catalysts. As a result, the NGCA composite catalyst exhibits a four-electron reaction path, and its ORR activity at 0.75 V is six times as high as that of N-doped graphene. Besides, an N-doped graphene/carbon nanotube composite catalyst could be also prepared by one-step chemical deposition.65 Simultaneous growth of graphene and carbon nanotubes results in a three-dimensional spatial structure. The specific surface area of graphene and carbon nanotubes reached 812.9 m2 g−1, and the conductivity reached 53.8 S cm−1. Although the nitrogen content of the composite catalyst is only 0.53 %, its ORR catalytic performance is very good, close to that of industrial Pt/C catalyst, and its long-term stability is much higher than that of Pt/C catalyst.
In addition, the hybrid composites of N-doped graphene and N-doped carbon nanotubes also show superior ORR performance under acidic conditions. For example, Dai and co-workers synthesized a N-doped graphene/carbon nanotube (CNT) catalyst, which exhibited high activity and stability in the acidic PEMFCs.66 These low-cost, metal-free, carbon-based ORR catalysts show promising practical application prospects for acidic PEMFCs.
In conclusion, N-doped graphene prepared by various methods is one of the most efficient metal-free ORR electrocatalysts.50a, 67 The dopant nitrogen atoms can affect the spin density and electron cloud distribution of adjacent carbon atoms and thus induce the formation of “active centers”, which can directly participate in ORR.44, 68 There are still many controversies about the ORR active sites of N-doped graphene.26d, 69 In addition to N-doped graphene, N-doped carbon nanostructures such as 3D N-containing polymers,51 N-doped carbon nanocapsules,70 N-CNT cups,71 and N-doped mesoporous carbon72 have also shown excellent activity in ORR electrocatalysis.3b
Sulfur-doped graphene
Since the electronegativities of S (2.58) and C (2.55) are similar, charge transfer can be ignored in the C−S bond. However, contrary to the zero spin density of undoped graphene, the mismatch between the outermost orbitals of S and C leads to uneven spin-density distribution on S-doped graphene. It was suggested that S-doped graphene is formed by defect formation and S bonds break in two steps. The S-doped graphene sheet could be a small-band-gap semiconductor, more metalized than the original graphene.73 Graphene doped with S has a higher resistance than pristine graphene.74 Using first-principles calculations, Denis et al. proposed that S-doped graphene is feasible for ORR, but its catalytic effect is not as good as that of N-doped graphene.75 Jeon et al. found that covalently bonded S and oxidized S at the serrated and armchair-like edges of nanometer-sized graphene obtained from ball milling could lead to a significant increase in spin density.26a, 76 Xia et al. found that the change in atomic spin density plays an important role in oxygen reduction activity by DFT calculations.77 Zhang et al. calculated the distribution of atomic charge and spin density, as shown in Figure 8. Graphene decorated by sulfur does not exhibit additional spin density, because sulfur atoms do not introduce additional unpaired electrons. Charge density redistributes on S-doped graphene clusters with Stone–Wales defects. The positive charge densities of carbon atoms 11, 15, 89, and 93 at the serrated edge are about 0.17 higher than those of other carbon atoms. It is speculated that these carbon atoms may be the catalytic sites of ORR. Calculations on the adsorption of OOH or O2 at these sites show that both OOH and O2 can be adsorbed on the sawtooth edge of graphene with Stone–Wales defects, but not on graphene without Stone–Wales defects. These active sites play an active role in promoting ORR. Figures 8 c and d are similar in that the substituent S atoms are located at the serrated edge. Atoms with high charge densities are also located at the sawtooth edge, and these atoms also generate spin density. As shown in Figure 8 e and f, the spin and charge densities of these sulfur oxide defective graphene structures are distributed on the edge of the armchair. Interestingly, the spin and charge densities of carbon atoms adjacent to sulfur oxide are also high. It is shown that S-doped graphene clusters not only polarize more spin and charge density with Stone–Wales defects, but also contribute to the catalysis of ORR. Similarly, as shown in Figure 8, atoms with higher charge density are distributed along the zigzag edge. Its value is less than 0.19. The authors tested these atoms with high charge density and spin density. The results showed that atoms with charge density greater than 0.20 and spin density greater than 0.15 can absorb OOH or O2, and this suggests that they may be potential active centers of ORR. Figure 8 h shows the charge-density distribution on pure graphene clusters. There is no spin density on pure graphene clusters, and the maximum charge density is 0.17. OOH and O2 cannot be adsorbed on carbon atoms. The results show that the catalytic activity of pure graphene is not good, which further proves that the graphene clusters doped with sulfur atoms have a positive effect on the catalytic activity of ORR.

Sulfur-doped graphene can be obtained by using dibenzyl disulfide as sulfur source and graphene oxide as raw material. The ORR catalytic activity of S-graphene-600 is higher than that of graphene-600 (Figure 9 a). The catalytic activity can be improved by increasing the annealing temperature, and the ORR activity of S-graphene-1050 is close to that of Pt/C (Figure 9). Recently, Zhang et al. prepared S-doped graphene by using sulfonate ion-exchange resin as carbon precursor. The obtained S-doped graphene has similar electrocatalytic activity to Pt/C, but better stability and methanol resistance.79 Most of the research showed that the onset potential and the number of electrons transferred per oxygen atom for S-doped graphene were similar to those for N-doped graphene. Xia et al. proposed a catalytic mechanism of ORR on S-doped graphene.78 XPS results show that S is mainly doped in the form of −C−S−C− or −C−SO2−C−C− on the edge or surface of graphene.79, 80

The ORR activity of pure graphene is very low, whereas S-doped graphene can show enhanced charge and spin density, which are conducive to the adsorption of O2. The active sites on these S-doped graphene clusters are the carbon atoms located at zigzag edges or near SO2-doped structures, which have high positive charge density and spin density. The two-electron transfer pathway is known to occur on substituent sulfur atoms with high charge density, while the four-electron transfer pathway occurs on carbon atoms with high spin or charge density. Sulfur-doped graphene expands the family of metal-free carbon-based nanomaterials and is a new electrocatalyst to replace Pt in fuel cells.10a, 26a Even though the electrocatalytic activity of S-doped graphene for ORR is still lower than that of commercial Pt/C, the synergistic effect of sulfur and carbon materials on the development of metal-free ORR electrocatalysts provides a feasible strategy to design new ORR electrocatalysts.
Phosphorus-doped graphene
It is proposed that nonmetal atom dopants in graphene can better regulate the electronic structure and thus improve the electrochemical properties of the ORR. To improve the energy-storage properties of graphene, various attempts have been made. Among them, the introduction of heteroatoms (O, N, S, B, and P) is one of the effective methods to improve the electrochemical performance of graphene electrode materials,81 which has the advantage of changing the electronic properties of carbon materials and influencing charge distribution on adjacent atoms.10a Dopant heteroatoms generate induced charges and change the chemical adsorption by redistribution of charges. They can effectively weaken the O−O bonding, and thus make it easy for the positively charged carbon atoms to attract electrons and promote the ORR process.3a, 52a P-doped graphene can also improve the electron-donor properties of carbon materials and thus enhance the catalytic activity.82 The ORR activity of P-doped graphene was higher than that of nondoped graphene.10e Peng et al. studied P-doped carbon nanospheres for ORR in both acidic and alkaline media and found that the ORR activity was higher in alkaline media, but the long-term stability of the materials was better in acidic media.83 Zhang et al. also found that P doping significantly improved the electrochemical performance of graphene in ORR and lithium-ion batteries.84 Liu et al. synthesized P-doped graphene by pyrolysis of toluene and triphenylphosphane, which could be used as ORR catalyst.10e, 63a, 85
In addition, it was found that P-doped graphene is more stable in air than N-doped graphene and exhibits n-type semiconductor characteristics.86 P-doped graphene can be applied in supercapacitors. For example, Yang et al. used P-enriched activated carbon as a supercapacitor and found that P-enriched activated carbon can not only improve the performance and capacitance of the supercapacitor but also broaden the potential of the battery in water electrolyte. Graphene oxide and phosphoric acid were treated at high temperature to enhance the voltage window of graphene. However, the capacitance of P-doped graphene is low, only 29 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density.87 In 2016, Pate et al.5a prepared P-doped porous carbon materials by a microwave method. As shown in Figure 10 a, the coordination of P atoms can be controlled. This P-doped carbon has a special structure (Figure 10 b). A porous carbon block is sandwiched between two shrunken graphene-like sheets. The reason for formation of this structure may be that the diameter of the P atom is larger than that of the C atom and doping with P atoms causes local geometric stress in the carbon network around each P atom.

N/P-codoped graphene
In addition to N-doped graphene as a nonmetallic electrocatalyst, researchers have focused their attention on nonmetallic electrocatalysts with nitrogen and phosphorus as codopants.63f, 86, 88 Zhu et al.89 proposed that N- and P-doped honeycomb carbon is an efficient electrocatalyst for ORR. The material was prepared by direct pyrolysis of popcorn in a static semi-open environment. It shows layered porous structure and the ORR activity is close to that of standard Pt/C. The P/N-codoped graphene prepared by pyrolysis of a mixture of graphene and dicyandiamide showed a marked increase in catalytic activity for ORR in phosphoric acid solution.90 N/P-codoped graphene/carbon nanosheets (N,P-GCNS) were prepared by pyrolysis of the mixture of GO, polyaniline, and phytic acid (Figure 11). Compared with singly N or P doped catalysts, N/P-codoped graphene catalysts are more active.91

N/S-codoped graphene
To improve the interaction between doped elements and dopants, doping with two kind of heteroatoms can be effective.92 Codoped graphene as an electrocatalyst shows a significant improvement in ORR.65, 76, 93 To improve the catalytic activity of ORR, dopants are usually introduced into the carbon lattice.39, 69b Researchers have used two dopant elements to adulterate graphene.93a, 94 In the case of doubly doped carbon materials, S atoms can induce polarization of adjacent C and N atoms.95 This can form unique electronic distributions and further induce synergistic effects.96 N/S-codoped graphene can efficiently improve the catalytic activity in ORR.20, 78, 97 Guan et al. prepared N/S-codoped graphene with enhanced ORR activity from pyrimidine and thiophene.63c Qiao et al. proved this hypothesis by DFT calculations.10d
It is proposed that the three-dimensional voids on the graphite surface constitute its unique stratified structure.98 It has high surface area, abundant active sites at the interface of electrochemical reaction, and good electron/electrolyte transport characteristics. Li et al. prepared S,N-codoped graphene nanosheets by pyrolysis of melamine and dibenzyl sulfide.99 The schematic diagram of the synthesis process of S,N-codoped graphene carbon nanosheets is shown in Figure 12 a. Taking graphene nanosheets loaded with S1N6 as an example, the catalytic activity of graphene nanosheets annealed at 700, 800, 900, and 1000 °C was tested in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte (Figure 12 b). The results showed that the catalytic activity of S1N6 annealed at 900 °C was the best, which was higher than that of Pt/C. From Figures 12 c and d, it can be concluded that the synergistic effect of S and N atoms in S/N-codoped carbon materials plays a key role in ORR in both alkaline and acidic media. Compared with singly S or N doped graphene, S/N-codoped graphene carbon nanosheets have higher ORR activity.

Higgins et al. prepared S/N-codoped graphene/CNT (GC-NLS, in which L denotes low-temperature), as shown in Figure 13 a.65 Firstly, CNTs dispersed on graphene oxide surface were partially reduced, and nitrogen was doped in ammonia at 500 °C. In the second step, N-doped graphene oxide was mixed with phenyl disulfide and the mixture heat-treated at 900 °C. This distribution-by-distribution doping can significantly increase the nitrogen content. Even though the surface concentration of sulfur measured by XPS is only 0.23 %, the beneficial effect on ORR is significant, and the change of GC structure after codoping is minimal (Figure 13 b). In 0.1 m KOH electrolyte (Figure 13 c), the initial potential of GC-NLS is 0.85 V versus RHE, which is 70 mV higher than that of codoped graphene (G-NLS), and 50 mV higher than that of S/N-codoped CNTs (C-NLS). The half-wave potential (0.72 V vs. RHE) also increased by 50 mV compared with that of C-NLS.65 Wohlgemuth et al. also found that the introduction of sulfur atoms can increase the structural defects, polarizability, and catalytic activity for ORR under alkaline conditions.63c, 100 N/S-codoped carbon foams with continuous and hierarchical structure show wide application prospects as ORR metal-free electrocatalysts.101 Su et al. found that the catalytic activity of S/N-codoped 3D graphene involves mainly four-electron transfer in 0.1 m KOH.97

Summary and Perspectives
Nonmetal-doped graphene materials have a great application prospects in energy catalysis due to their excellent catalytic activity and stability for ORR. Compared with graphene, nonmetal-doped graphene can not only improve the electronic structure of graphene, but also create more active sites for ORR. The 2D structure and adjustable surface of graphene play an important role in doping with different nonmetal elements, which improve the stability and catalytic activity for ORR. To date, N-, P-, and S-doped graphene materials have exhibited excellent ORR performance. Among them, N-doped graphene exhibits higher ORR activity than N- and S-doped graphenes. Moreover, N/S- or N/P-codoped graphene can further enhance ORR performance.
However, the ORR activity of most of the nonmetal-doped graphene without metal active sites in acidic media is insufficient, since they show high overpotential. The ORR activity can be significantly improved by assembling the N-doped graphene with N-doped carbon nanotubes due to the porous structures with a large surface area. Another familiar strategy to improve the ORR activity is introducing metal ions (e.g., Fe, Co) into the system. However, in the popular PEMFCs, the acid-corrosion resistance of most transition metals is lower than that of carbon. Therefore, for commercialization of fuel cell technology, improvement of the degree of graphitization is crucial to enhance the corrosion resistance of the nonmetal-doped graphene materials.
Currently, most of the research on ORR on nonmetal-doped graphene catalysts is carried out in alkaline media and is mainly in the experimental stage rather than practical commercial applications in fuel cells. Since acidic PEMFCs are more practical than alkaline ones, development of efficient and stable nonmetal-doped graphene ORR catalysts operating in acidic media is vital and urgent for future PEMFC technology.
