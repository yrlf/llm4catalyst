Single-atom Fe-N-C electrocatalysts have emerged as the most promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst. However, the low Fe loading and inaccessibility of Fe-N-C sites limit the overall ORR activity. Here, we report an efficient single-atom electrocatalyst (Fe-N-C/N-OMC) with Fe-N-C sites embedded in three-dimensional (3D) N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon framework. Fe-N-C/N-OMC shows high half-wave potential, kinetic current density, turnover frequency and mass activity towards ORR in alkaline electrolyte. Experiments and theoretical calculations suggest that the ultra-high ORR activity stems from the boosted intrinsic activity of FeN4 sites by graphitic N dopants, high density of accessible active site generated by high Fe and N loadings and ordered mesoporous carbon structure as well as facilitated mass and electron transport in 3D interconnected pores. Fe-N-C/N-OMC also shows comparable ORR activity to Pt/C in acidic electrolyte. As the cathode for zinc-air battery, Fe-N-C/N-OMC exhibits high open-circuit voltage, high power density and remarkable durability.

In recent decades, traditional fossil energies have experienced severe problems, including resource shortage and environmental pollution [
[1]

[3]
]. Renewable electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems represents promising technologies to address global energy and environmental challenges. Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a significant electrochemical process in a wide range of renewable electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, including metal-air batteries and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) [
[4]
,
[5]
,
[6]
,
[7]
,
[8]
]. However, the overall efficiency of these devices is severely impeded by the sluggish kinetics of electrochemical reduction of oxygen molecules. At the present stage, Pt-based catalysts act as the benchmark ORR catalysts to accelerate the reaction [
9
,
10
]. But the supply scarcity, high cost and poor durability of Pt significantly restrict their commercial applications [
[11]
,
[12]
,
[13]
,
[14]
]. In response, various Pt-free catalysts with high ORR activity and stability have been explored, and transition-metal single-atom electrocatalysts (denoted as M-N-C, M = Fe, Co, Zn, Cu, Mn, Cr, Mg, etc.) are regarded as one of the most promising alternatives [
[15]
,
[16]
,
[17]
,
[18]
,
[19]
]. Among reported M-N-C catalysts, Fe-based single-atom electrocatalysts (Fe-N-C) exhibit the highest ORR intrinsic activity in alkaline electrolyte revealed both theoretically and experimentally, even higher than those of Pt/C catalyst [
[20]
,
[21]
,
[22]
].
In general, Fe-N-C electrocatalysts are prepared by pyrolysis of composite precursors containing Fe, N and C, which generates N-coordinated single-atom Fe sites anchored in the carbon framework [
[23]
,
[24]
,
[25]
]. Unfortunately, the pyrolysis process at high temperatures made the obtained carbon framework rich in disordered micropores. A large number of single-atom active sites embedded in the disordered micropores are hardly accessible and contribute negligible to the catalytic performance due to the steric hindrance and the large mass transport resistance [
[26]
,
[27]
,
[28]
,
[29]
,
[30]
]. Increasing the loading amount of iron precursors to generate more single-atom sites usually results in the aggregation of iron species and generates catalytically inactive particles [
31
,
32
]. The synthesis of Fe-N-C electrocatalysts with high Fe loading and fully exposed active sites is of critical significance to further improve ORR activity.
Herein, we develop a three-dimensional (3D) N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (N-OMC) supported Fe-C-N catalyst (Fe-N-C/N-OMC) by using KIT-6 as the hard template and a mixture of Fe(II)-Phen complex and 2-methylimidazole as the Fe, N and C precursors. Both the ordered mesoporous structure of the carbon framework and the FeN4 active site are confirmed with small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption and desorption, aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Experiments and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations suggest that N dopants in the carbon framework play two roles: Coordinated N dopants interact with central Fe atoms to form the FeN4 active sites; and graphitic N dopants enable the FeN4 active site shows preferable adsorption energy for oxygen-containing intermediates and thus boost the intrinsic ORR activity of the FeN4 active site. Fe-N-C/N-OMC exhibits excellent ORR performance in terms of high half-wave potential, high kinetic current density, high mass activity and high turnover frequency (TOF) in alkaline aqueous electrolyte, which stems from boosted intrinsic activity of single-atom FeN4 sites by graphitic N dopants, the high density of accessible active site generated by high Fe and N loadings and ordered mesoporous structure of N-OMC as well as the facilitated mass and electron transport by 3D interconnected pores of N-OMC. In addition, Fe-N-C/N-OMC also shows comparable ORR activity to Pt/C in acidic electrolyte. As catalysts for zinc-air batteries, the cells with Fe-N-C/N-OMC air cathode show high power density, large specific capacity and remarkable durability. Our work on the novel Fe-N-C/N-OMC electrocatalyst provides a new approach to develope highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts by combining catalytic active sites with nanoarchitecture engineering, which opens up new avenues for the development of cost-effective and high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage systems.
Typically, FeSO4·7H2O (0.055 g) and 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate (0.096 g) were dissolved in 10 mL methanol and stirred for 0.5 h. Then, 2-methylimidazole (2-MI, 0.66 g) was added. The mixture was stirred for another 1 h and then added into KIT-6 powder (1 g) under stirring. Methanol was evaporated at 80 °C. Then the impregnation process was repeated for three times. The collected sample was pyrolyzed in a tube furnace at 800 °C for 3 h under flowing argon. The obtained sample was denoted as Fe-N-C/KIT-6. The silica template was removed by HF solution. The collected solid sample was thermally treated at 800 °C for 3 h under argon once again. The obtained sample was denoted as Fe-N-C/N-OMC. The synthetic procedure for N-OMC was similar to Fe-N-C/N-OMC without the addition of FeSO4·7H2O precursor. The synthetic procedures for binary FeNi-N-C/N-OMC and ternary FeNiMn-N-C/N-OMC catalysts were similar to Fe-N-C/N-OMC by using FeSO4·7H2O, Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O or Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O as the metal precursors with the molar ratio of 1:1 for Fe:Ni and 1:1:1 for Fe:Ni:Mn, respectively.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was taken on a JEOL JEM-2100F field emission electron microscope at 200 kV. The single-atom Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalysts were characterized with high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). Atomic resolution HAADF-STEM images were taken on a Titan 80-300 scanning transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV, equipped with a probe spherical aberration corrector. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Nova-450 electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a ULVAC PHI Quantera spectrometer with the binding energy calibrated with C 1s at 284.6 eV. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXRD) patterns were collected on a X'Pert 3 X-ray powder diffractometer operating at 40 kV and 40 mA with monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm). Small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray powder diffractometer. Nitrogen sorption experiments were conducted at 77 K by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 equipment. Raman spectra were recorded on a LabRam HR800 instrument with an excitation wavelength of 514.5 nm. The Fe loading of Fe-N-C/N-OMC was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES, Thermo Fisher, USA). Elemental analysis results were obtained on Varian EL cube element. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was conducted on the beam line of 1W1B end station of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). The storage rings of BSRF were operated at 2.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA. The Fe K-edge spectra were recorded under fluorescence mode using a Lytle detector. Athena and Artemis codes were used to extract the data and fit the profiles. The finely grounded sample powder was coated on the adhesive tape for XAS measurements.
The theoretical calculation was conducted with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [
33
], a DFT software package. The projected-augmented wave (PAW) method was applied to treat the ion-electron interactions [
34
]. The exchange-correlation energies were calculated under the GGA scheme parameterized with PBE method [
35
]. The energy cut-off was set to 400 eV and the self-consistent convergence was 0.0001 eV atom-1. The spin polarization was considered in this work. The structure was constructed with the monolayer graphite with 9 × 9 two dimensional supercell and the width of the vacuum layer was 20 Å. For Fe-N-C/OMC, a FeN4 structure was constructed in the supercell (
Fig. 3
a), and for the Fe-N-C/N-OMC, two C atoms were replaced by N atoms beyond the FeN4 structure (
Fig. 3
b). All structures in this work are completely optimized. The computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) method set up by Nørskov was used to calculate the reaction free energy (△G) of each electron transfer step in the oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) [
36
]. Under the standard conditions (pH = 0, p = 1 bar, T = 298 K), the △G of the reaction (A* + H+ + e- → AH*) could be calculated with the following reaction (A* + 1/2H2 → AH*). Through this way, △G = G(AH*)–G(1/2H2)–G(A*) + eU’, where U’ is the electrode potential (vs. SHE). Under alkaline conditions, the relationship between U’ and U is U = U’ + 0.059 pH.
All electrochemical tests were performed on a PINE electrochemical instrumentation equipped with a high-speed rotator. A conventional three-electrode system was used with a glassy carbon rotating disk electrode (RDE) as the working electrode (0.196 cm2), a glassy-carbon (GC) as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (1 M KCl) electrode as the reference electrode. All potentials reported were calculated versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), i.e. ERHE=EAg/AgCl+0.0592pH+E°Ag/AgCl (E°Ag/AgCl = 0.235 V), (pH = 12.9 for 0.1 M KOH and pH = 0.3 for 0.5 M H2SO4). 4 mg of the electrocatalyst sample and 40 μL Nafion solution (5 wt.%) were dispersed in 2 mL ethanol under sonication treatment for 0.5 h to form homogeneous catalyst ink. Then 30 μL of the catalyst ink was loaded onto the surface of RDE and dried at room temperature. The electrolyte in the cell was saturated by flowing nitrogen or oxygen for 0.5 h before testing. The electrochemical experiments tests for ORR were performed in oxygen saturated 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 at room temperature. The RDE tests were performed at rotating speeds from 400 to 2025 rpm at a sweep rate of 5 mV s-1. The OER experiments were performed in oxygen saturated 0.1 M KOH at a rotating speed of 1600 rpm. The electrocatalytic activity of the samples was examined by linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 at room temperature. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted in nitrogen or oxygen saturated 0.1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 50 mV s-1 at room temperature.
The turnover frequency (TOF) is estimated by the following Equation:
(1)
Where jk is the kinetic current density at 0.85 V (A cm-2), Ne is electron number per Coulomb (6.24 × 1018), ωFe is the metal content in the catalyst, ccat is the catalyst loading on the electrode, NA is Avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023), MFe is molar mass of Fe (55.8 g ∙ mol-1).
Typically, a polished Zn foil and 6.0 M KOH solution containing 0.2 M zinc acetate were used as the anode and the electrolyte, respectively. The cathode was prepared by loading Fe-N-C/N-OMC, Pt/C or Pt/C-RuO2 (mass ratio, 1:1) on the cleaned Ni foam. The flexible zinc-air batteries were assembled with a solid polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene oxide (PVA-PEO) polymer electrolyte as the separator. A thin layer of the catalyst and a cleaned Zn foil were placed on opposite sides of the PVA-PEO polymer electrolyte. The components were pressed together firmly. The PVA-PEO polymer electrolyte was prepared as follows. Specifically, 3 g polyvinyl alcohol and 0.3 g polyethylene oxide were dissolved in 30 mL deionized water at 90 °C for 1.5 h, then 1 mL 18 M KOH solution was added. The mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 0.5 h, cooled down to room temperature, poured into a PTFE mould and frozen for 12 h before use.
Typically, Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalysts were mixed with Super P and Nafion, pasted onto a clean Ni foam and used as the electrode for the discharging process. Carbon-free NiFe-LDH nanosheets grown on the Ni foam were used as the electrode for the charging process. A polished Zn foil was used as the anode and 6 M KOH with 0.2 M zinc acetate was used as the electrolyte. For noble-metal catalysts, the tri-electrode zinc-air battery was assembled similarly with Pt/C as the cathode during discharging process and RuO2 as the cathode during charging process, respectively.
Single-atom Fe-N-C/N-OMC was synthesized via a template casting method, as shown in
Fig. 1
a. Firstly, the ordered mesoporous silica template (KIT-6) with a pore size of 8.4 nm was impregnated with a methanol solution containing Fe(II)-Phen complexes and 2-methylimidazole (2-MI). The obtained sample was thermally treated under Ar atmosphere to transform the precursors into N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon framework. The silica template was removed by HF solutions and the residue was further thermally treated under Ar atmosphere to produce the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst.

(j) Corresponding FT-EXAFS fitting curves of Fe-N-C/N-OMC with the inset showing the schematic model of FeN4 center: Fe (yellow), N (blue) and C (brown).
Small-angle XRD pattern of Fe-N-C/N-OMC clearly shows two diffraction peaks assigned to the (211) and (220) facets of cubic-structured OMC framework (la3d space group) (
Fig. 1
b), suggesting the generation of long-range ordered mesoporous structure of Fe-N-C/N-OMC after removal of KIT-6 template. Compared with KIT-6 template, the diffraction peaks shift by 1.1 and 1.25°, indicating the pore size of Fe-N-C/N-OMC is shrunk during the thermal treatment process. Nitrogen sorption results of Fe-N-C/N-OMC shows the type-IV adsorption-desorption isotherms with a hysteresis loop between 0.4 and 0.8 (Fig. S1), which is a typical mesoporous characteristic. The BJH pore size of Fe-N-C/N-OMC is 3.8 nm (Fig. S2), smaller than that of KIT-6 (8.4 nm). The specific surface area and pore volume of Fe-N-C/N-OMC are 401 m2 g-1 and 0.54 cm3 g-1, respectively, signifying the high porosity. The texture parameters of KIT-6, Fe-N-C/KIT-6 and Fe-N-C/N-OMC are listed in Table S1. In HR-TEM image, the OMC framework of Fe-N-C/N-OMC was clearly observed with an interplanar spacing of 8.1 nm (
Fig. 1
c), which is consistent with the small-angle XRD results. Ordered mesoporous structure of N-OMC featuring well-defined pore structure and high specific surface can highly disperse the Fe-N-C sites and provide more exposed active sites [
[37]
,
[38]
,
[39]
].
In wide-angle XRD patterns, similar to the pure N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon support (N-OMC), Fe-N-C/N-OMC only shows two diffraction peaks at 25° and 43°, assigned to (002) and (101) diffractions of graphitic carbons (Fig. S3), respectively. No diffraction peaks ascribed to iron species (such as metallic iron, iron oxides, iron carbides, iron nitrides etc.) were detected, implying the probable isolated single-atom features of Fe species. The Fe loading in the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst is as high as 2.9 wt% measured by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Raman spectrum of Fe-N-C/N-OMC displays two peaks at 1348 and 1571 cm-1 with a ID/IG value of 1.79 (Fig. S4), indicating the highly graphitic feature of N-doped OMC framework. In HR-TEM image, no nanoparticles or nanoclusters are observed for Fe-N-C/N-OMC (
Fig. 1
c). Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping of Fe-N-C/N-OMC clearly shows the uniform distribution of Fe over the entire N-doped carbon framework (Fig. S5). Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of Fe-N-C/N-OMC exhibits typical amorphous rings (Fig. S6), demonstrating that no crystallized iron species form during the thermal treatment process at 800 °C. In the aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image (
Fig. 1
d), single-atom Fe sites are directly observed in the form of isolated brighter spots due to the contrast difference of heavier Fe with N and C. Isolated single-atom Fe sites are homogeneously dispersed all over the entire N-doped OMC framework.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to investigate the binding states of Fe, N and C in the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst. The XPS survey spectrum clearly shows the peaks corresponding to Fe, N and C in the Fe-N-C/N-OMC sample, implying the co-existence of Fe and N in the carbon framework (Fig. S7). The high resolution XPS spectrum of Fe 2p shows two peaks at around 710.2 and 722.9 eV belonging to the Fe-N configuration (
Fig. 1
e), which suggests that all Fe species exist in an uniform state in the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst. The peaks at around 714.9 and 728.7 eV are assigned to the satellite peaks of Fe. No peaks belonging to other iron species, such as metallic iron, iron oxides, iron carbides, iron nitrides etc., were detected, indicating the uniform single-atom Fe-N-C structure. The XPS spectrum of N 1s in the Fe-N-C/N-OMC sample can be deconvoluted into three peaks: pyridinic N at 398.3 eV, Fe-N (N atoms coordinating with Fe atoms) at 399.4 eV and graphitic N at 401.0 eV (
Fig. 1
f). The binding states of N in Fe-N-C/N-OMC are schematically illustrated in
Fig. 1
g. Pyridinic N provides coordination sites to central Fe atoms to form the active FeNx sites and graphitic N embedded in the carbon matrix boosts the intrinsic ORR activity of the FeNx sites as discussed below. Elemental analysis results demonstrated that N content in the Fe-N-C/N-OMC sample is up to 12.4 wt% (Table S2), which is the main reason for the high single-atom Fe loading of 2.9 wt%. In the C 1s XPS spectrum (Fig. S8), the peak at 285.6 eV assigned to the carbon atoms bonding with N atoms further confirms the formation of N-doped carbon framework.
To unravel the coordination structure and chemical state of Fe-N-C/N-OMC in the atomic level, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were performed. The Fe K-edge XANES profiles in
Fig. 1
h shows that the oxidation state of the isolated Fe atoms in Fe-N-C/N-OMC is higher than metallic Fe° and lower than Fe3+, suggesting the oxidation of isolated Fe atoms in Fe-N-C/N-OMC due to the coordination of Fe with adjacent N atoms. XANES measurements are consistent with the XPS results. Specially, Fe-N-C/N-OMC shows a pre-edge peak at 7113 eV with an additional peak at 7131 eV, which can be ascribed to the absorption features of Fe with a square planar geometry. As shown in
Fig. 1
i, the FT-EXAFS curve of Fe-N-C/N-OMC only shows a main peak at 1.44 Å, which can be ascribed to Fe-N scattering paths, meanwhile the Fe-Fe peak at about 2.22 Å is absent, implying that Fe species in the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst predominately exist in the isolated single-atom form. The EXAFS fitting was conducted to obtain the quantitative structure parameters of Fe in the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst. The EXAFS fitting curves are shown in
Fig. 1
j, Fig. S9 and Table S3. The coordination number of N to the central Fe atom is approximately four with a Fe-N bond length of 1.98 Å, indicating the formation of a square planar FeN4 structure, as shown in the inset of
Fig. 1
j. Besides the unary Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst, this template casting method could also be used to prepare binary FeNi-N-C/N-OMC and even ternary FeNiMn-N-C/N-OMC catalysts. Corresponding characterizations of wide-angle XRD, STEM and EDX were shown in Figs. S10-S13.
ORR performance of the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) in 0.1 M KOH alkaline electrolyte using a rotating disk electrode (RDE). CV curves were measured in N2 and O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. As shown in
Fig. 2
a, both Fe-N-C/N-OMC and commercial Pt/C catalyst display obvious cathodic peaks under O2-saturated conditions, implying an evident oxygen reduction process. The ORR peak for Pt/C appears at 0.84 V, while the ORR peak for Fe-N-C/N-OMC reaches 0.93 V, approximately 93 mV higher than that of Pt/C, suggesting that Fe-N-C/N-OMC shows higher ORR activity than that of commercial Pt/C. The ORR activities were further examined by RDE in an O2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. As shown in
Fig. 2
b, Fe-N-C/N-OMC exhibits an onset potential (Eonset) at 1.08 V and a half-wave potential (E1/2) at 0.93 V, much more positive than Pt/C (Eonset at 1.02 V and E1/2 at 0.86 V) and most ORR electrocatalysts reported in the literatures as listed in
Fig. 2
d and Table S4. Without single-atom FeN4 sites, the bare N-OMC catalyst shows an onset potential at 0.87 V and a half-wave potential at 0.76 V, which are much lower than those of Fe-N-C/N-OMC, demonstrating that isolated FeN4 centers function as the ORR active sites. Meanwhile, as depicted in
Fig. 2
b, Fe-N-C/N-OMC displays a limiting current density of 8.14 mA cm-2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and a rotating speed of 1600 rpm, much higher than that of Pt/C (6.57 mA cm-2) and N-OMC (3.31 mA cm-2). The kinetic current density of Fe-N-C/N-OMC reaches 57.4 mA cm-2 at 0.85 V, which is superior to that of commercial Pt/C (7.5 mA cm-2) and most reported ORR catalysts (
Fig. 2
c and d). Corresponding turnover frequency (TOF) and mass activity for Fe-N-C/N-OMC are 38.4 s-1 and 66.4 A mgFe-1, respectively, outperforming those of Pt/C (4.81 and 2.38 A mgPt-1). The electrochemical active surface area of Fe-N-C/KIT-6 measured by double-layer capacitance (Cdl) is 4.07 cm2 mg-1 (Fig. S14). After removal of KIT-6 template, the active surface area of Fe-N-C/N-OMC increased to 11.04 cm2 mg-1 (
Fig. 2
e), higher than that of Pt/C (6.95 cm2 mg-1) (Figs. S15 and S16), indicating that the 3D ordered mesoporous structure of carbon framework increases the electrochemical active surface area of Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst. As a result, more accessible FeN4 active sites become available. The calculated ORR Tafel slope for Fe-N-C/N-OMC is 75 mV dec-1, lower than that of Pt/C (83 mV dec-1) and N-OMC (147 mV dec-1) (
Fig. 2
f), illustrating that the 3D ordered mesoporous structure of carbon framework enhances mass transport process, provides favorable ORR kinetics and thus decreases the Tafel slope of Fe-N-C/N-OMC.

To further gain insight into the reaction mechanism of Fe-N-C/N-OMC, the RDE tests were performed by varying rotation speeds from 400 to 2025 rpm.
Fig. 2
g shows that the current densities increase with the increment of rotation speed, while the onset potentials maintain constant under various rotation speeds. The inset in
Fig. 2
g exhibits the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots of Fe-N-C/N-OMC, which shows excellent linearity under different potentials, suggesting that the transferred electron numbers per oxygen molecule in ORR process are almost the same. The average electron transfer number (n) of Fe-N-C/N-OMC calculated from the K-L plot is 3.96 approaching that of Pt/C (n = 3.98), indicating a four-electron oxygen reduction process for Fe-N-C/N-OMC in alkaline media.
The durability of Fe-N-C/N-OMC was tested by cycling the catalyst between 0.6 and 1.0 V at a sweep rate of 50 mV s-1 in oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. After 5000 cycles, E1/2 only shows 5 mV shift (
Fig. 2
h), indicating that Fe-N-C/N-OMC possesses excellent stability in the alkaline electrolyte. For the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst measured after 5000 CV cycles, no diffraction peaks belonging to iron species (such as metallic iron, iron oxides, iron carbides, iron nitrides etc.) were detected in XRD patterns and no nanoclusters or nanoparticles were observed on the N-OMC skeleton in TEM images (Figs. S17 and S18), implying that Fe species remain dispersed in single-atom state after accelerated durability test (ADT) and show outstanding stability in alkaline electrolytes. After the addition of 0.1 M methanol into the electrolyte cell, the oxygen reduction peak disappeared for commercial Pt/C catalyst, whereas no obvious change occurs for Fe-N-C/N-OMC (
Fig. 2
i), suggesting its excellent tolerance to methanol. This property is very important for cathode catalysts in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).
In order to gain insight into the origin of high ORR activity of Fe-N-C/N-OMC in alkaline electrolyte, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted. As shown in
Fig. 3
a and b, two optimized configuration were constructed. For Fe-N-C/OMC, a FeN4 center is embedded in the graphite matrix without N doping. For Fe-N-C/N-OMC, a FeN4 center is embedded in the graphite matrix with two C atoms substituted by N atoms. Bare N-OMC catalyst without FeN4 sites shows poor ORR activity (
Fig. 2
b). Therefore, the FeN4 center is denoted as the ORR active site. The proposed 4e- ORR mechanism in alkaline electrolyte is listed in Fig. S19.

(c) Free energy diagram for the four-electron oxygen reduction pathway on Fe-N-C/OMC (blue) and Fe-N-C/N-OMC (red) in alkaline media at U = 0 V, 0.66 V and 0.77 V, respectively, with the inset showing adsorbed *OOH, *O and *OH intermediates on the FeN4 site.

Fig. 3
c shows the free energy diagram of the four-electron oxygen reduction pathway on Fe-N-C/OMC and Fe-N-C/N-OMC in alkaline electrolyte. At U = 0 V, for Fe-N-C/OMC, the absolute value of free energy change (|△G|) in the first step (|△G1| = 0.66 eV, from O2 to *OOH) is the smallest one, implying that the first step dominates the ORR overpotential. In comparison, for Fe-N-C/N-OMC, the absolute value of △G in the third step (|△G3| = 0.77 eV, from *O to *OH) is the smallest one, suggesting that the third step determines the ORR overpotential. At U = 0.66 V, for Fe-N-C/OMC, the |△G1| is zero, meaning that the limiting potential for Fe-N-C is 0.66 V. For Fe-N-C/N-OMC, all reactions are exothermic processes in view of the fact that all of the elementary reaction steps are downhill. At U = 0.77 V, for Fe-N-C/N-OMC, the |△G3| is zero, implying that the limiting potential is 0.77 V. For Fe-N-C/OMC, the first and the third steps are endothermic processes. From the free energy diagram, it clearly indicates that after graphitic N doping, the rate-determining step shifts from the first step to the third step with the decrease of theoretical overpotential of 0.11 V. Hence, the graphitic N dopants boost the ORR intrinsic activity of the FeN4 center.
The adjustment of |△G| values for the ORR elemental reaction steps with graphitic N dopants can be attributed to the preferable adsorption of *OOH and *OH intermediates on the FeN4 center. When *OOH is generated, the Bader charge of Fe atom on Fe-N-C/N-OMC is smaller than that of Fe-N-C/OMC, while the Bader charge of two O atoms on Fe-N-C/N-OMC are larger than the counterparts of Fe-N-C/OMC (
Fig. 3
d), which suggests that the Fe-O bond on Fe-N-C/N-OMC is stronger than that of Fe-N-C/OMC. Therefore, the adsorption energy of *OOH on Fe-N-C/N-OMC is larger than that of Fe-N-C/OMC. Similarly, when *OH is produced, the Fe-O bond on Fe-N-C/N-OMC is stronger than that of Fe-N-C/OMC (
Fig. 3
e), which leads to the adsorption energy of *OH on Fe-N-C/N-OMC larger than that of Fe-N-C/OMC. Consequently, with N doping, the adsorption energies of *OOH and *OH increase 0.16 eV and 0.12 eV, respectively, which makes a preferable activation route for oxygen-containing species.
Further evidences were obtained by examining the electronic structure of the single-atom Fe center, especially the projected density of states (PDOS), as the d-band center is highly correlated with the metal-adsorbate interaction. The calculated PDOS of Fe-3d states for Fe-N-C/OMC and Fe-N-C/N-OMC are shown in
Fig. 3
f (spin-down states) and S20 (spin-up states), respectively. Compared with Fe-N-C/OMC, the Fermi level (EF) of Fe-N-C/N-OMC increased from 0 eV to 0.18 eV and two small spin-down peaks of Fe-dyz and Fe-dzx around the Fermi level are completely occupied, suggesting that more charges transferred from Fe-3d orbitals into O-2p orbitals after N doping. The charge transfer from Fe-3d to O-2p enhances the Fe-O bond and thus improves the activation of O-containing species on the FeN4 center. Three types of molecular orbital hybridization are observed for Fe-N-C/N-OMC with *OOH adsorption, i.e. Fe-3dxy and O-2pz, Fe-3dyz and O-2px, and Fe-3dz2 and O-2py (Fig. S21-S23). Compared with Fe-N-C/OMC, more electrons are accommodated into the conjugated molecular orbitals for Fe-N-C/N-OMC, which pushes the Fermi level and Fe-3d states to higher levels, increases adsorption energies of O-containing species and boosts the ORR intrinsic catalytic activity.
Besides excellent ORR performance in the alkaline electrolyte, Fe-N-C/N-OMC also exhibits high ORR activity in the acidic electrolyte. As shown in
Fig. 4
a, both Fe-N-C/N-OMC and commercial Pt/C show apparent oxygen reduction peaks under O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, demonstrating an evident oxygen reduction process. The ORR peak of Fe-N-C/N-OMC reaches 0.73 V (vs. RHE), only 10 mV lower than that of commercial Pt/C (0.74 V), which manifests that Fe-N-C/N-OMC shows high ORR activity in acidic conditions. The ORR activities were further examined by RDE in an O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. As shown in
Fig. 4
b, Fe-N-C/N-OMC exhibits an onset potential (Eonset) of 0.91 V and a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.73 V, close to commercial Pt/C (Eonset = 0.92 V and E1/2 = 0.74 V) (
Fig. 4
b and c). Meanwhile, Fe-N-C/N-OMC displays a limiting current density of 5.65 mA cm-2, higher than that of Pt/C (5.41 mA cm-2). The kinetic current density of Fe-N-C/N-OMC reaches 0.21 mA cm-2, lower than that of commercial Pt/C (0.35 mA cm-2), as shown in
Fig. 4
c. In
Fig. 4
d, ORR Tafel slope for Fe-N-C/N-OMC is 76 mV dec-1, lower than that of Pt/C (81 mV dec-1), demonstrating that Fe-N-C/N-OMC shows more favorable ORR kinetics due to enhanced mass and electron transport in 3D interconnected mesopores of Fe-N-C/N-OMC.

(b) ORR polarization curves of Fe-N-C/N-OMC and commercial Pt/C in an oxygen-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. (c) Kinetic current density (jk) and half-wave potential (E1/2) of Fe-N-C/N-OMC and commercial Pt/C. (d) Tafel plots of Fe-N-C/N-OMC and commercial Pt/C in oxygen-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4.

(f) ORR polarization curves before and after 5000 potential cycles for Fe-N-C/N-OMC in 0.5 M H2SO4.
To further gain insight into the reaction mechanism on Fe-N-C/N-OMC, the RDE tests were performed at different rotation speeds from 400 to 1600 rpm.
Fig. 4
e shows that the current densities are increased with increasing rotation speed, while the onset potentials maintain constant under various rotation speeds. The inset in
Fig. 4
e exhibits the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) plots of Fe-N-C/N-OMC, which shows excellent linearity under different potentials, suggesting that the transferred electron numbers per oxygen molecule in ORR process are almost the same. The average electron transfer number (n) for Fe-N-C/N-OMC calculated from K-L plot is 3.93 approaching that of Pt/C (n = 3.98), indicating a four-electron oxygen reduction process for Fe-N-C/N-OMC.
Long-term stability of electrocatalysts is an important parameter for acidic ORR applications, especially for Fe-based electrocatalysts due to the Fenton reaction. The ORR stability for Fe-N-C/N-OMC was tested by cycling the catalyst between 0.7 and 0.9 V at a sweep rate of 50 mV s-1 in oxygen-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4. After 5000 cycles, negative shift of E1/2 was less than 10 mV (
Fig. 4
f), indicating Fe-N-C/N-OMC exhibited good stability in the acidic electrolyte.
Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) have been regarded as one of the most promising energy storage systems due to their environmental friendliness, low cost and high theoretical specific energy density (1084 Wh kg-1) [
[44]
,
[45]
,
[46]
,
[47]
]. The excellent ORR performance of Fe-N-C/N-OMC in alkaline electrolyte promoted us to use it as the air cathode for zinc-air batteries. Firstly, Fe-N-C/N-OMC was used as the cathode of the primary zinc-air battery (Fig. S24). Fe-N-C/N-OMC shows an open-circuit voltage of 1.55 V (Fig. S25 and S26), outperforming that of commercial Pt/C (1.44 V) and most reported electrocatalysts due to the better ORR activity of Fe-N-C/N-OMC. As shown in
Fig. 5
a, the zinc-air battery with the Fe-N-C/N-OMC cathode delivers a peak power density of 113 mW cm-2, much higher than that of Pt/C (81 mW cm-2). Three coin-type Fe-N-C/N-OMC-based zinc-air batteries in series with an open circuit voltage of 4.63 V could successfully lighten a LED array and power the electrochemical water splitting cell in 1 M KOH electrolyte with large quantities of hydrogen and oxygen produced on the NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) electrodes (Fig. S27-S29), demonstrating practical application of the Fe-N-C/N-OMC-based zinc-air battery with a high power density. The zinc-air battery with the Fe-N-C/N-OMC cathode shows a discharge specific capacity of 711 mA h g-1, higher than that of Pt/C (582 mA h g-1) (
Fig. 5
b). When the zinc-air battery with the Fe-N-C/N-OMC cathode was galvanostatically discharged at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for more than 2800 min, the discharge voltage maintains at 1.27 V, higher than that of Pt/C (1.15 V) (
Fig. 5
c). Negligible activity decay is observed.

It is well-known that NiFe-LDH catalysts display excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline media [
48
]. For the first time, we assembled a tri-electrode zinc-air battery by using Fe-N-C/N-OMC as the cathode for discharge, NiFe-LDH as the anode for charge and zinc plate as the zinc sources (
Fig. 5
d). Compared with the noble-metal based tri-electrode zinc-air battery with Pt/C as the cathode and RuO2 as the anode, the non-noble-metal tri-electrode zinc-air battery provides a higher peak power density of 114 mW cm-2 (
Fig. 5
e). The non-noble-metal tri-electrode zinc-air battery successfully runs for more than 4000 min with a round-trip efficiency of 67% (
Fig. 5
f), while the noble-metal based tri-electrode zinc-air battery only runs for approximately 1100 min with a round-trip efficiency lower than 57%.
For rechargeable zinc-air batteries, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) takes place during the discharging process, while oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs during the charging process [
44
]. Therefore, ORR-OER bi-functional electrocatalysts are highly required as the oxygen electrode [
[45]
,
[46]
,
[47]
]. Furthermore, the OER performance of the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst was investigated. As shown in
Fig. 5
g, Fe-N-C/N-OMC provides an OER overpotential of 531 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 (denoted as Ej10) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, which is very close to that of RuO2 (520 mV), although the Tafel slope of Fe-N-C/N-OMC is larger than that of RuO2 (Fig. S30 and S31). According to previous work [
49
], the electron-withdrawing pyridinic N moieties embedded in the OMC skeleton serve as the OER active sites. The high pyridinic N content enables the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst exhibiting remarkable OER performance. The potential difference ΔE (ΔE = Ej10-E1/2) is a significant parameter to evaluate the bi-functional catalytic performance of electrocatalysts towards ORR and OER. For Fe-N-C/N-OMC, ΔE is about 0.83 V, smaller than that of the mixed noble-metal catalysts (Pt/C and RuO2, 0.89 V). Bi-functional properties of various electrocatalysts are listed in Table S4. The bi-functional property of Fe-N-C/N-OMC towards ORR and OER encouraged us to use it as the cathode to assemble rechargeable and flexible zinc-air batteries with a PVA-PEO hybrid film as the solid electrolyte (Fig. S32). Fig. S33 shows that the flexible zinc-air battery delivers a peak power density of 71 mW cm-2 and it can stably operates for more than 650 min at a discharging and charging current density of 1 mA cm-2 (
Fig. 5
h). The round-trip efficiency of the flexible zinc-air battery with the Fe-N-C/N-OMC cathode is approximately 65%, much higher than that with the mixed noble-metal (Pt/C + RuO2) catalysts (
Fig. 5
h). As shown in Fig. S34 and S35, a flexible zinc-air battery can power a digital clock and two zinc-air batteries in series can lighten a LED in bending mode, indicating the practical application of Fe-N-C/N-OMC in the flexible zinc-air batteries.
In summary, a template casting approach with KIT-6, Fe(II)-Phen and 2-MI precursors was developed to prepare single-atom Fe-N-C/N-OMC electrocatalyst with FeN4 active sites embedded in 3D interconnected ordered mesoporous carbon framework. The Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst shows outstanding ORR performance in terms of high half-wave potential, high kinetic current density, high mass activity and high TOF in alkaline electrolyte. DFT calculation demonstrates that graphitic N dopants in the graphitized carbon matrix change the Fe 3d states, provide preferable adsorption energy for oxygen-containing intermediates on the FeN4 active site and boost the intrinsic ORR activity of the FeN4 site. The ultra-high ORR efficiency of Fe-N-C/N-OMC stems from the high Fe and N loading amounts, the high intrinsic activity of single-atom FeN4 sites, the 3D interconnected ordered mesoporous structure of the carbon framework and the large electrochemical active surface area, which enable Fe-N-C/N-OMC with high intrinsic activity and dense accessible active sites. In addition, Fe-N-C/N-OMC also shows comparable ORR activity to Pt/C in acidic electrolyte. As the air cathode of zinc-air batteries, the cell with the Fe-N-C/N-OMC catalyst delivers high power density, large specific capacity and remarkable durability. This designing strategy of combining high intrinsic activity with dense accessible active sites pave a new route to rationally design highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.
