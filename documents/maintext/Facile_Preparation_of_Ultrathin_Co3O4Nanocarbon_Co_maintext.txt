Introduction
With the increasing crises of dwindling energy supplies and environmental pollution, scientists have made great efforts to develop clean and sustainable sources of energy.1-4 Water splitting is an efficient way to produce hydrogen and oxygen directly from water by photocatalysis or electrocatalysis.5 The efficiency of water splitting is, however, largely hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics.6 As a result, OER catalysts have been explored intensively to facilitate such processes. To date, ruthenium oxides and iridium oxides are regarded as the most efficient OER electrocatalysts.7 Nevertheless, the expensive price and poor stability under basic conditions greatly limit their application. Under such circumstances, Co-based oxides, with relatively low cost and higher earth-abundance, have attracted great attention.8, 9 For example, Dai et al. reported Co3O4 nanocrystals on N-doped reduced graphene oxide as a synergistic catalyst for water oxidation with a low overpotential of 310 mV in 1 m KOH, which is superior to the commercial IrO2 OER catalyst.10 Qiao et al. reported porous Co3O4–carbon nanowire arrays with higher OER activity, more favorable kinetics, and stronger durability in comparison to an IrO2/C electrocatalyst.11 Zhao et al. developed a Co3O4/graphene nanocomposite, which showed a better performance than the bulk Co3O4 with an overpotential of 313 mV in 1 m KOH and 498 mV in phosphate buffer solution.12 It was demonstrated that the surface area and electronic states of Co3O4 are two main contributors for its catalytic performance;13 bulk cobalt oxides are normally less active for OER due to their surface status and low surface area.14, 15 Despite great efforts, development of highly efficient Co3O4-based electrocatalysts remains challenging.
Recently, ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets with few-layers stacking were demonstrated to be very promising materials for electrochemical catalysis, due to their large surface-to-volume ratio, thickness on the atomic scale, and high exposure of the active atoms.14 The presence of Co2+ in the ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets can improve the electroactivity of the resultant composite materials because the Co2+ can promote the formation of cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as an active site for OER.13 As a 2D inorganic graphene analogue, the ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets show structural disorder of the surface atoms, which leads to improved electrical conductivity and accelerated reaction kinetics.16
Here, nanocomposite materials were prepared based on ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets, with 0D CS, 1D CNTs, or 2D rGO (CS=carbon spheres, CNTs=carbon nanotubes, rGO=reduced graphene oxide) through a one-pot hydrothermal strategy, which results in the formation of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO, Co3O4/CNTs, and Co3O4/CS nanocomposites. On application of these nanocomposites for OER for the first time, it was found that the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO shows a low overpotential of 290 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 68 mA dec−1 in 1 m KOH. Furthermore, there is no obvious current density decay after the stability test. The presence of the rGO can significantly improve the efficient charge transfer and surface area of the composite.17, 18 This effective layer-stacked architecture can accelerate reaction kinetics and shorten the transmission distance of electrons between the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets and rGO. In addition, compared with ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets with a Co2+/Co3+ ratio of 1.2, the as-prepared ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite shows a Co2+/Co3+ ratio of 1.4. The higher Co2+/Co3+ ratio indicates that more oxygen vacancies can be formed under the experimental conditions.
Results and Discussion
The ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbon (including CS, CNTs, and rGO) nanocomposites can be obtained by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method (see Supporting Information). Taking the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite as an example, it can be seen from Figure 1 a that the Raman spectrum shows peaks at 1354 cm−1 (D band) and 1599 cm−1 (G band) that can be attributed to the sp2- and sp3-hybridized carbon atoms, respectively.19 Meanwhile, the F2g (188 and 515 cm−1), Eg (468 cm−1), and A1g (674 cm−1) modes of Co3O4 can be observed clearly in Figure 1 a.20 Furthermore, the intensity ratio of D band to G band (ID/IG, 1.033) in the nanocomposite is higher than that of GO (0.972), indicating the GO has been reduced to rGO after the hydrothermal reaction. The rGO in the nanocomposite contains defects after removal of large amounts of oxygen-containing functional groups (-OH and -COOH) under hydrothermal conditions.19 In addition, the G band of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite shows an obvious shift to lower wavenumber of about 12 cm−1 compared with that of GO (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information), which indicates an interfacial charge transfer has occurred and thus the strong coupling effect between the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets and the GO nanosheets is confirmed.16

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of GO, ultrathin Co3O4, ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite are shown in Figure 1 b. The GO shows a large interlayer distance of 0.8 nm (2θ=10.4°) due to the formation of hydroxyl, epoxy, and carboxyl groups. A small peak at around 25.8° can be observed in the GO pattern, indicating that traces of starting material (graphite flakes) remain in the prepared GO.21 After the hydrothermal procedure, the GO is reduced to rGO, and the (0 0 2) peak is shifted from 10° to 23°, which is due to the disordered stacking of graphene sheets.22 The characteristic peaks (1 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), (5 1 1), (4 0 0), and (4 4 0) of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite can be attributed to the Co3O4 component, whereas the peak of (0 0 2) can be assigned to rGO in the nanocomposite.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy can detect the surface properties of electrocatalysts. Because the electrocatalysis reaction mainly occurs on the surface of electrocatalysts,13 it is essential to investigate the surface electronic states of Co3O4 in the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite. The wide scan XPS spectrum (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information) shows the existence of C, O, and Co elements in the nanocomposite. The fine-scanned Co 2p XPS spectra of the Co3O4 nanosheets and ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite (Figure 2 a and b) exhibit two peaks at 795 and 780 eV, corresponding to the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 spin-orbit peaks, respectively.

To probe the electronic states of Co atoms, the Co 2p spectra of both Co3O4 nanosheets and ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite were fitted for peak deconvolution, in which the two peaks for Co 2p3/2 are Co3+ (ca. 779.5 eV) and Co2+ (ca. 780.8 eV), respectively.23 The atomic ratio of Co2+/Co3+ in the Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite can be calculated to 1.4, which is higher than that of the Co3O4 nanosheets of 1.2, indicating that relatively more Co2+ is present in the ultrathin Co3O4. This result suggests that surface oxygen vacancies are generated under the experimental conditions, which can be further confirmed by the fine-scanned O 1s XPS spectra. Figure 2 c shows two oxygen peaks in the O 1s region of ultrathin Co3O4 and Figure 2 d shows four oxygen peaks in the O 1s region of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposites. O1 at 529.9 eV is typical for metal–oxygen bonds, whereas O4 at the higher value of 531.5 eV partly resulted from reduction of the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets under the hydrothermal conditions with rGO. The appearance of the O4 peak in the O 1s region of the nanocomposites (with the relative ratio of 0.2865) indicates the presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface of ultrathin Co3O4 and rGO.24 Similar properties are also found in the ultrathin Co3O4/CNT and ultrathin Co3O4/CS, with an O4 ratio of 0.1622 and 0.1587, respectively (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information).
Figure 2 e and f show the C 1s XPS spectra of GO and ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite. As shown in Figure 2 f, the peaks centered at 284.6, 286, 288, and 289 eV can be assigned to the C−C/C=C, C−O, C=O, and O−C=O groups of rGO in the composite, respectively.25 Furthermore, the C−O of GO is clearly higher than that of ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite, which is in good accordance with the Raman result.
SEM characterization was performed to observe the difference of surface morphology of ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets and the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite. As shown in Figure 3 a and c, the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets exhibit a flower-like structure with a smooth surface. The surface of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite is fluffy, with more staggered holes or folds, and rougher than that of the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets. SEM images clearly show that the specific surface area of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite is larger than that of the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets, which is consistent with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis result with surface areas of 30.68 and 133.52 m2 g−1 for ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets and ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite, respectively (Figure 3 e and f and Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). In addition, the element mapping measurement by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Figure S1) provides further evidence for the structure of ultrathin Co3O4/rGO.

TEM images of the GO nanosheets and HRTEM images of the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets and Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite reveal the structure of each compound (Figure 4). As shown in Figure 4 a, GO nanosheets are largely transparent with crumpled structure. The ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets are a layer-like structure (Figure 4 b). For the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite (Figure 4 c and d), the crystallized ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets and the rGO nanosheets are staggered with respect to each other, which is confirmed by the high magnification images clearly showing two different crystal lattices. This corresponds to the well-textured ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets and rGO nanosheets.17, 26

To demonstrate universality of this one-pot hydrothermal method for synthesis of various ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbon composite materials, the method was extended from the rGO (2D) to other nanocarbons including 1D CNTs and 0D CS. The morphology and further details about the ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbon composites are given in the Supporting Information. All the ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbons were successfully synthesized and well characterized.
The OER performances of the ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbon composites have been evaluated using a typical three-electrode setup in O2-saturated 1 m KOH electrolyte.27 The as-prepared electrodes have an average mass loading of 0.2 mg cm−2 active material on carbon paper. Cyclic voltammogram measurements (50 mV s−1) were carried out to activate the catalyst electrode. Then, the OER performance is given by a linear scan for ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets, ultrathin Co3O4/CNTs, Co3O4/CS, and Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite, respectively (Figure 5 a). It can be seen that the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite shows a lower overpotential (290 mV vs. Hg/Hg2Cl2) than the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets (380 mV), ultrathin Co3O4/CNTs (324 mV), and ultrathin Co3O4/CS nanocomposites (332 mV), respectively. This result correlates to the XPS and BET analysis data, that is, more O4 in the nanocomposite and higher surface area are both beneficial for the OER performance for the ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbon composites. Furthermore, compared with the commercial IrO2/C electrode under the same experimental conditions, the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO shows a better performance with a lower overpotential.

To further investigate the relationship of the OER performance and the surface area, BET measurements were performed to show that the surface areas of the ultrathin Co3O4, Co3O4/CS, Co3O4/CNTs, and Co3O4/rGO are 30.68, 74.94, 110.65, and 133.52 m2 g−1, respectively (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). The involvement of nanocarbons prevents the aggregation of ultrathin Co3O4 in the as-prepared ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbon composites, resulting in larger surface area than that of ultrathin Co3O4. In addition, compared with the ultrathin Co3O4/CS and Co3O4/CNTs, the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite gives the largest surface area.
The ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbon composites show great OER performance, which can be attributed to the presence of nanocarbons because they cannot only increase the conductivity of the nanocomposites, but also act as anchoring sites to immobilize active materials and prevent aggregation.28, 17 Furthermore, the remaining oxygen-containing groups (-COO-, C-O-C) on the rGO may be active sites to expedite oxygen evolution because they can render the adjacent carbon atoms positive by electron-withdrawn oxygen atoms in a rGO π-system (Figure S13), and these positively charged carbon atoms can absorb OH− or H2O through electrostatic forces, which promotes the electron transfer between catalyst and the reaction intermediates such as O22− and O2−, resulting in high OER activity.29
It is worth noting that the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets show a better OER catalytic activity than the bulk Co3O4, which can be attributed to the complete exposure of the Co ions on the surface of the Co3O4 and that the low thickness facilitates efficient diffusion of chemicals and the escape of the generated O2 within the electrode.13, 30, 31 After combination with the rGO, the Co2+ population in the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite is higher than that of the pristine ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets. As a result, the Co3+ ions occupy the octahedral (Oh) positions and then convert into Co2+,32 which is in good accordance with the result of G band analysis. This mechanism can be explained based on the above XPS results. The higher ratio of Co2+/Co3+ can benefit the OER performance as evidenced by the in operando identification of geometrical-site dependent OER activity of spinel Co3O4.33 Based on the theoretical calculation, Liu et al. concluded that Co2+ was the active site for OER. The Co2+ could promote the formation of cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) as active sites for OER.33 The improved Co2+/Co3+ ratio of the nanocomposites indicates more surface oxygen vacancies can be formed in the nanocomposite. The obtained ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite has a much higher surface area than the 2D ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets. As such, the OER performance of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite has been promoted dramatically.
The OER kinetics of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO, Co3O4/CNTs, Co3O4/CS, and ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets electrode have been investigated using Tafel plots. The ultrathin Co3O4/rGO catalyst exhibits a Tafel slope of 68 mA dec−1 in 1 m KOH (Figure 5 b), which is lower than the ultrathin Co3O4/CNTs (77 mA dec−1), ultrathin Co3O4/CS (80 mA dec−1), and ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets (95 mA dec−1). This result suggests that the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO catalyst exhibits the most favorable reaction kinetics due to its large surface area and optimized content. As can be seen from Table 1, the mesoporous Co3O4 nanoflakes show good electrochemical performance with the overpotential of 380 mV and 48 mA dec−1 Tafel slope in 1 m KOH and 1 mA cm−2, whereas the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite displays an overpotential of 290 mV and 68 mA dec−1 Tafel slope under the same experimental conditions. Compared with other Co3O4-containing composite materials reported in the literature (Table 1), the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposites show excellent performance with a lower overpotential and low Tafel slope.

The stability study on the ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbons has been carried out in 1 m KOH as shown in Figure 5 c. With a constant overpotential, it can be observed that the OER current densities remain stable for different ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbons electrodes. The negligible degradation after more than 10 h of testing reveals excellent stability of the as-prepared nanocomposites.
Finally, to further investigate the surface impact of OER catalyst, the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbons (Figure S15 in Supporting Information) has been calculated by measuring the charge collected in the Hupd adsorption/desorption region after double-layer correction at a scan rate ranging from 1 to 5 mV s−1 (Figure 6).34 Double-layer (dl) capacitance values of ultrathin Co3O4, ultrathin Co3O4/CS, ultrathin Co3O4/CNTs, and ultrathin Co3O4/rGO are 40.39, 82.10, 89.28, and 260.21 mF cm−2, respectively. It is clear that the capacitance for the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO electrode is much higher than the others. As such, better OER performance can be obtained by the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite. Furthermore, the sheet resistance of ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposites were measured to be 1.6×102 Ω sq−1, whereas the sheet resistance of pristine ultrathin Co3O4, ultrathin Co3O4/CNTs, and ultrathin Co3O4/CS were 6.8×102, 1.8×102, and 3.1×102 Ω sq−1, respectively (Table S2 in the Supporting Information), which directly prove the higher conductivity of ultrathin Co3O4/rGO. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis also revealed that the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO has a better conductivity with a much lower liquid resistance, RL, and charge transfer resistance (RCT) than the pristine ultrathin Co3O4, ultrathin Co3O4/CNTs and ultrathin Co3O4/CS (Figure S14 in the Supporting Information).

The corresponding charging current as a function of scan rate of the electrodes loaded with ultrathin Co3O4 (red line), ultrathin Co3O4/rGO (blue line), ultrathin Co3O4/CS (yellow line), ultrathin Co3O4/CNTs (green line).
Such excellent performance of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite is due to the following reasons: 1) the rGO exhibits high active surface area, which is superior to CNTs and CS. Additionally the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite shows better ECSA than other composites (Table S1), which is also a benefit for the OER. 2) Unlike the bulk crystals, the ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets exhibit higher exposure of surface area, which presents different chemical states from bulk Co3O4 and provides more active sites for OER. 3) The improved Co2+/Co3+ ratio in the nanocomposite has an important influence on the OER performance because more surface oxygen vacancies in the nanocomposite can act as the active cites for the OER. Therefore, the electrocatalytic activity and stability of the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite have been largely enhanced compared with bulk Co3O4.
Conclusions
In summary, a facile one-pot hydrothermal method was used to fabricate the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite successfully. Compared with the ultrathin 2D Co3O4 nanosheets, the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite shows not only increased surface area, but also an improved Co2+/Co3+ ratio, which significantly contributes to the large enhancement of the OER activity. Moreover, it can be observed that the OER current density remains stable, with negligible degradation after more than 10 h of testing, revealing excellent stability of the as-prepared ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite. To extend the adaptability of this method, ultrathin Co3O4/CS and Co3O4/CNTs nanocomposites were prepared; it was found that the ECSA of the ultrathin Co3O4/nanocarbon composites increases from 0D CS, 1D CNT, to 2D rGO. As such, the ultrathin Co3O4/rGO nanocomposite exhibits excellent OER activity and stability due to the large surface area and optimized electron status of Co. This work offers a new pathway for the design of highly efficient OER catalysts.

X-ray powder diffraction was performed on a Rigaku D/max-2500 equipped with a graphite monochromator using CuKα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB250 equipped with an AlKα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The X-ray source was operated at a reduced power of 150 W. The samples were mounted on the sample holder using double-sided adhesive tape. The pressure during analysis was kept below 10 Pa. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Zeiss Supra 55 SEM. High resolution TEM (HR-TEM) was conducted on JEOL JEM-2100 microscope using an accelerating voltage of 400 kV. Thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal analyses (DTA) were acquired using a Mettler–Toledo TG/DSC 1/1100 SF operated under N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. N2 adsorption/desorption was determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements using an ASAP-2020 surface area analyzer. The BET method was used to calculate the specific surface area of samples. The measurement of sheet resistance was carried out using the four point probe method in a sheet resistance measurement system (RTS-8) from Four Probes Tech.
Electrochemical measurement
A saturated calomel electrode was used as the reference electrode in all measurements and was calibrated with respect to a reversible hydrogen electrode (ERHE=ESCE+0.059×pH+0.2415). Cyclic voltammetry was conducted in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using a platinum counter electrode. Electrocatalytic activities were measured by using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) with a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100 KHz and amperometric it curves (IT) were recorded on an electrochemistry workstation (CH Instrument, Shanghai, China) in 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution. Double-layer capacitance measurements were made by taking CV at a scan rate that ranged from 1 to 5 mV s−1. For the measurement on carbon-fiber paper, the working electrode was prepared by loading 0.2 mg of sample on 1×1 cm2 carbon-fiber paper from its ethanol dispersion with Nafion (50 μL).
