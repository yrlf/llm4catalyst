A variety of electrode materials have been investigated for the ORR over the years. To date, Pt-based materials are the most successful electrocatalysts, even though the kinetics of the ORR on the precious metal is sluggish and causes performance losses in energy conversion devices. (1-6) In recent years, there has been great interest in the search and development of nonprecious catalysts (NPCs), in particular the nitrogen-containing carbon nanostructured catalysts, as an alternative to platinum for the ORR. (5-7) Various research groups reported the activity and stability of nitrogen-containing carbon nanostructures toward the ORR in basic, neutral, and acidic electrolyte media. (8-14) The experimental results accumulated over the years indicate that carbon and nitrogen without any metal (7-14) (in the form of CNx), or those with metal (5, 6) (in the form of MNxCy, where M = iron or cobalt), form highly active ORR catalysts. Yet, to date, there exists much controversy over the actual composition and structure of ORR active sites. Better understanding of the active site in these NPCs may lead to the development of materials that could completely eliminate the need for platinum in the energy conversion devices.
All of the extant methods employed for the preparation of nitrogen-doped CNT electrocatalysts involve the thermal decomposition of nitrogen-containing hydrocarbons over metal particles such as Fe, Co, Cu, and Ni (i.e., chemical vapor deposition method). (7-15) Therefore, the presence of metal impurities in the ORR catalysts could not be ruled out. Even though it is often claimed that metal only stabilizes the nitrogen species in a carbon lattice and does not participate in the ORR performance, the exact role of metal is not clear. As a result, it is believed that the ORR performance does not solely come from the microstructured CNx materials. One way to prepare similar microstructured CNx materials without the involvement of metal particles is the so-called template technique. (16) This method entails synthesis of a desired material by pyrolyzing a suitable polymer precursor within the cylindrical and uniform-sized pores of an alumina membrane so that the tubular morphology will remain for the final carbon material.
The present work focuses on the efforts undertaken to examine the optimum content and the influence of nitrogen in carbon materials on the electrocatalytic activity of the ORR. To prepare vertically aligned non-N-doped and N-doped carbon nanotubes without any metal impurities, a variety of polymer precursors, polyphenylacetylene (PPA), poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP), poly(3-methylpyrrole) (PMPy), poly(2-methyl-1-vinylimidazole) (PMVI), and poly(p-pyridazine-3,6-diyl) (PPP), having different nitrogen contents were taken in a template technique.
In a typical synthesis, the desired polymer is coated within the pores of an alumina membrane (Whatman, Anodisc47) by a suitable method. The membrane is washed thereafter with deionized water and dried. Subsequently, the membrane is carbonized in an electric furnace at 1173 K for 2 h under an argon gas atmosphere. The resulting carbon-alumina composite is treated with 6 M NaOH at room temperature to remove the alumina template. Finally, it is washed with distilled water to remove the residual impurities and obtain vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. More details of the experimental works are provided in Supporting Information. The prepared materials are characterized with XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and XPS.
Powder XRD pattern and first-order Raman spectra of the non-N-doped and N-doped CNTs are shown in Figure 1a and b, respectively. All of the materials exhibited the characteristic (002) and (100)/(101) diffraction peaks at 2θ values around 25 and 43°, respectively. However, the diffraction peaks of N-doped CNTs were shifted to lower 2θ values than those of non-N-doped CNTs. This is due to the slight distortion in crystalline regularity along the a or b direction by the introduction of nitrogen atoms in the carbon lattice. (13, 17) No significant change in the full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of the (002) and (100)/(101) diffraction peaks indicates the similar crystallite size. Also, the fact that the appearance of the (004) diffraction peak at a 2θ value around 52° indicates the good crystallinity of the material and, specifically, the high average number of graphenes stacked within the coherent domains. First-order Raman spectra show the D and G bands at ∼1355 and 1582 cm−1, respectively, in all of the prepared materials. The D band arises from the disordered sp2 hybridized carbon, whereas the G band is associated with the tangential stretching mode of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite and indicates the presence of crystalline graphitic carbon. The significant differences, such as increase in the ID/IG ratio, overlap between the D and G bands, marked broadenings of the fwhm of the D and G bands, asymmetric tailing of the D band at 1355 cm−1, and the shift of the G band to the high-frequency region with an increase in the nitrogen content in the CNT samples can be observed from the Raman spectra. These results are in good agreement with earlier reports. (8, 10, 18)

The top view of the alumina membrane is shown in Figure 2a. It shows the uniform-sized (100 nm diameter) pores present in the membrane. The pores and channels of the membrane have been effectively utilized for the polymerization and subsequent carbonization for the formation of vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. High-magnification SEM images of the prepared CNTs are shown in Figure 2b−f. The images clearly depict the open ends of the nanotubes. Low-magnification SEM images show the uniform, cylindrical, and vertically aligned nanotubes distributed in a regular array with an outer diameter of 100 nm and length of 60 μm that almost matches the pore dimensions of the alumina template (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In the case of CNTPMVI and CNTPPP samples, the regularity of the CNTs was slightly distorted at the open end of the tubes. This may be due to the introduction of C−N bonding, which is shorter than the C−C bonds. Since no catalyst has been used for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing carbon nanotubes, it is worth pointing out that the nanotubes produced by the template synthesis under the experimental conditions are virtually free from metal impurities.

To gain more insight into the structure of nitrogen atoms in the N-containing CNTs, XPS measurements were performed. XPS survey-scan spectra show a predominant C1s peak at around 284 eV in the non-N-doped CNTs, while the C1s and N1s peaks appear at around 284 and 400 eV in the nitrogen-doped CNTs (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The observed C1s peak mainly represents graphitic carbon. (10, 18) The spectra also show the presence of a very small amount of surface-adsorbed oxygen. The surface nitrogen concentration in CNTPPA, CNTP4VP, CNTPMPy, CNTPMVI, and CNTPPP is determined to be 0, 4.3, 5.6, 8.4, and 10.7 atom %, respectively. The deconvoluted XP N1s spectra of the N-doped CNTs are shown in Figure 3. The peaks at binding energies of 398.5 ± 0.1 (N1), 400 ± 0.1 (N2), and 401.5 ± 0.1 (N3) eV are attributed to the pyridinic-, pyrrolic-, and quaternary-type nitrogen functionalities, respectively, in the carbon lattice. (10, 18) It indicates the disruption of π conjugation on the outer layers of the carbon lattice due to nitrogen doping. Since the template technique involves the pyrolysis of polymers at high temperature (≥1173 K), there will be a possibility for the existence of different types of nitrogen species in both basal and edge planes of the carbon lattice. It is not surprising to observe mainly the pyridinic- and quaternary-type nitrogen in the prepared samples. It has been known that these are the only possible nitrogens that could survive at the treatment temperature of 1173 K or above. (15) The calculated atomic percentages of pyridinic-, pyrrolic-, and quaternary-type nitrogen functionalities in the prepared materials are given in Table 1. It depicts the increase in pyridinic-type nitrogen functionalities for the samples CNTPPA through CNTPMVI, whereas there was no appreciable change in the pyrrolic- and quaternary-type nitrogen functionalities for the samples ranging from CNTPPA to CNTPMVI.

In order to examine the effect of the nitrogen content in carbon nanotubes on the electrocatalytic ORR performance, linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were recorded in O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 5 mV/s over the electrode rotation rate of 1600 rpm, and the corresponding voltammograms are shown in Figure 4a. Significant differences between the non-N-doped and N-doped CNTs can be seen. A single reduction peak for the ORR is observed for the materials containing a nitrogen concentration up to 8.4 atom %. For each of the investigated materials, the onset potential for ORR, the potential where the current density increases to 10 μA/cm2, is given in Table 1. It clearly indicates that the incorporation of nitrogen in CNTs plays an important role in the ORR process. The significant positive shift in reduction peak and high steady-state diffusion current for N-doped CNTs, when compared to the non-N-doped CNTs, imply that the N-doped CNTs are more catalytically active and the kinetics of ORR more facile. The low ORR activity of non-N-doped CNTs may be due to the weak bonding of the intermediate oxygen reduction species. Among the N-doped CNTs, the material containing 8.4 atom % of nitrogen imparted good ORR activity. Such nitrogen enrichment might provide a higher density of catalytically active centers with low stereohindrance for binding redox species, followed by the complete reduction of oxygen to water. In the case of CNTPPP, which contains 10.7 atom % nitrogen, two reduction peaks at ∼0.35 and 0.05 V for the ORR are observed. The appearance of first and second peaks may be due to the partial reduction of O2 into H2O2, followed by further reduction to water. This type of behavior can be ascribed to the existence of two different nitrogen functionalities in the carbon lattice. For comparison, ORR measurements were performed on commercial Pt/C (E-TEK) under the same experimental conditions and are shown in Figure 4(a). Even though the better N-doped CNT material exhibits higher overpotential and lower ORR activity than Pt/C, there still is the possibility to improve the performance of N-doped CNTs by electrode fabrication or by modification of its electronic structure or by increasing the number of active sites through synthesis. Chronoamperometry was used to characterize the stability of the electrodes. The current density−time plots of N-doped CNT (i.e., CNTPMVI) and Pt/C electrodes in O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4 at the kinetically controlled potential region are shown in Figure 4b. The test was performed for 3 h. The stability of the N-doped CNT electrode was found to be better than that of the Pt/C electrode.

According to the results, the increase in ORR activity is most closely correlated to the pyridinic-type nitrogen functionality. Previous literature reports (8-10) also suggested the enhanced ORR activity in the CNx catalysts containing pyridinic-type nitrogen functionalities. This is ascribed to the conjugation effect of the nitrogen lone pair electrons on the nitrogen and graphene π-system. Computer simulations also support this hypothesis, showing that the barrier to ORR at a carbon atom can be reduced in the presence of an adjoining nitrogen atom. (19, 20) More recently, Keith J. Stevenson and co-workers (21) reported the influence of nitrogen concentration in the N-doped CNTs on the electronic, structural, and electrochemical properties. They reported the increase in bulk electrical conductivity, work function, and the density of states at the Fermi level with the increased nitrogen doping in CNTs. This may stem from the existence of a electron-rich nitrogen site, for example, pyridinic nitrogen, which possesses a lone pair of electrons in addition to an electron donated to the conjugated π-bond system (mixed σ−π valence states). It implies that the nitrogen doping in CNTs causes the material to behave in a more metallic manner. It was also reported that nitrogen doping in carbon nanotubes will result in chemically active, localized areas of higher electron density and promotes the electrocatalysis of ORR in aqueous electrolytes. The existence of more pyridinic functionalities in the N-doped CNT (8.4 at.%) prepared from the pyrolysis of poly(2-methyl-1-vinylimidazole) may be one of the reasons for facilitating reductive O2 adsorption at open-circuit conditions. The low ORR activity observed for the sample containing 10.7 atom % N-doped CNTs may be due to the existence of less pyridinic- and more quaternary-type nitrogen functionalities. Quantum chemical calculations (19) reveal that carbon radical sites formed adjacent to substitutional nitrogen in graphite are active for O2 electroreduction to H2O2 in acid electrolyte, and this may explain the catalytic effect (i.e., the appearance of two reduction peaks) observed for CNTPPP. On the basis of the XPS results and available literature data, we conclude that pyridinic-type nitrogen atoms at some particular geometrical positions in the carbon lattice are important to exhibit better ORR activity. Further studies are in process to predict the correct geometry of nitrogen atoms in graphite lattice for the complete ORR process.
In summary, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes, containing nitrogen ranging from 0 to 10.7 atom %, were synthesized, and structural features were examined with XRD, Raman, SEM, and XPS. The electrocatalytic activity for ORR increases with the pyridinic-type nitrogen functionalities in VA-CNTs. The N-CNT electrodes are found to be more stable than the commercially available Pt/C. These results suggest that the ORR activity of nitrogen-containing CNTs may be improved by generating a greater number of pyridinic-type active sites in the carbon structure.
Experimental Methods
Powder XRD patterns were obtained on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer operating with the Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5408 Å) generated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The morphology of the CNTs was examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL JSM-6480). Micro-Raman scattering experiments were performed on a ISA Jobin-Yvon Inc. Model T64000 FT-Raman at room temperature in a quasi-backscattering geometry with parallel polarization incident light. The excitation source used was an Ar ion laser operating at 514.5 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of catalysts were obtained using a PHI Quantera instrument equipped with a Mg monochromatic X-ray (hν = 1253.6 eV) source at a power of 350 W.
The rotating disk electrode (RDE) technique is employed to investigate the electrochemical ORR activity of the materials. The measurements are performed at room temperature in a one-compartment electrochemical glass cell assembled with a catalyst-coated RDE disk (Pine Instruments Inc., U.S.A.) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl, 3.5 M KCl (+0.205 V vs NHE) as the reference electrode, and Pt foil as the counter electrode. The working electrode is fabricated as follows; 1 mg of catalyst is dispersed in 1 mL of isopropanol by ultrasonication for 20 min. Subsequently, 5 μL of the catalyst suspension is pipetted on a mirror-finished RDE disk (5 mm diameter). Then, the catalyst is covered with 5 μL of a diluted 5 wt % Nafion solution and dried at room temperature. For oxygen reduction measurements, LSVs are recorded between +0.2 and +1.2 V versus NHE at a scan rate of 5 mV/s and rotation rate of 1600 rpm in O2-saturated 0.5 M H2SO4. The stability of the electrodes is ascertained by chronoamperometry. Water purified via a Milli-Q water purification system is used throughout the experimental work.
