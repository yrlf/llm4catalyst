{'Abstract': 'The exploitation of a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is urgently demanded by the wide application of clean hydrogen energy. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of an amorphous film of the cerium doped cobalt oxide (CoOx(Ce)) and its prominent performance in catalysing the OER. The film was deposited by a scalable electrostatic spray deposition method. Cerium doping induces the variation of the crystal structure of cobalt oxide from crystalline to amorphous. Meanwhile, cerium-related oxygen vacancies were introduced with cerium doping, while the chemical state of the cobalt species was unmodified. These factors lead to a drastic increase in the electrochemical surface area and the intrinsic activity of the resultant CoOx(Ce) in the OER. As a consequence, the CoOx(Ce) shows a reduced activation energy of the OER. The amorphous CoOx(Ce) film produces a current density of 20 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 261 mV, and that of 100 mA cm−2 at 302 mV. The performance is competitive to those of the reported electrocatalysts and commercially available RuO2.', '1. Introduction': "Cerium oxide modification is an emerging approach to promote the performance of OER electrocatalysts. Its multivalent nature is beneficial for electron exchanges in the matrices, and therefore in the fine tuning of the matrices' electronic structure and OER performance. Electron transfer from CeO2 to Co in cobalt selenide is responsible for an improved OER performance.17 Partial reduction of Fe(+2) in iron hydroxide induced by CeO2 loading leads to activity enhancement.18 The loading of CeOx to nickel oxide19–21 and cobalt oxide22 can tune the ratio of the +2 valence atoms to +3 valence atoms, and accordingly the number of active sites in the corresponding oxide. A similar effect was found in hollow CoS composited with CoOx.23 However, the host compounds introduced above contained metal ions of multiple valencies, and the contribution of Ce was attributed to the reduction of the +3 valence ions to the +2 valence ions. It is yet to be revealed whether the performance of a sample composed merely of +2 valence metal ions can be promoted by Ce modification.\nHerein, we report the facile synthesis of a thin film of cobalt oxide (CoOx) doped by Ce, denoted as CoOx(Ce), the modulation of both the crystal and the chemical structure of CoOx by Ce doping, and the superb performance of CoOx(Ce) in catalysing the OER. Ce doping can drastically induce a structure variation in CoOx from crystalline nanoparticles (3.2 ± 0.9 nm diameter) to an amorphous structure. The chemical structure of the Co ions is identical in both CoOx and CoOx(Ce), while Ce doping brings a new cerium-related O vacancy in CoOx. Consequently, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and the intrinsic activity of CoOx(Ce) in the OER were increased, and the apparent activation energy of CoOx(Ce) in the OER was decreased. The CoOx(Ce) can produce a current density of 20 mA cm−2 at the overpotential of 261 mV, and that of 100 mA cm−2 at 302 mV. The CoOx(Ce) shows superior performance in catalysing the OER in comparison with those of CoOx, commercially available RuO2 nanoparticles, and other reported OER electrocatalysts. The facile synthesis, unique structure, and superb performance introduced here will endow CoOx(Ce) with a promising future in industrial water splitting.", '2. Results and discussion': 'The morphology of CoOx(Ce) was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1b and c show that CoOx(Ce) was homogenously deposited on the surface of the CFP. A closer examination of the SEM image (Fig. 1d) shows that a copious amount of pores can be found on the surface of the CFP; the diameter of these pores is around 50 nm. Cracks can be found in the CoOx(Ce) film. The presence of these pores and cracks is associated with the fast solvent evaporation during the ESD. An energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectrum of the CoOx(Ce) film (Fig. S1a in the ESI†) shows the presence of Co, Ce, and O in the film, and the atomic ratio of Ce to Co is 1:8.8, in approximated accordance with the content of Ce in the precursor solution. The thickness of the CoOx(Ce) film was estimated to be ca. 200 nm, according to a crack that exposed the cross-section of the film (Fig. S1c in the ESI†). A sample without Ce doping, denoted as CoOx, was also synthesized by using a precursor solution similar to that used to deposit CoOx(Ce), except that no Ce source was introduced. The morphology of CoOx is analogous to that of CoOx(Ce), as shown by the SEM images (Fig. S2 in the ESI†).\nAn X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment was used to reveal the crystal structure of CoOx(Ce) and CoOx; no apparent diffraction peaks could be found in the corresponding pattern (Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The microstructures of CoOx(Ce) and CoOx were further assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2a shows a high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of CoOx, which shows well-defined lattice fringes. The typical size of grains in CoOx is 3.2 ± 0.9 nm (Fig. S2f in the ESI†). CoOx(Ce) shows a different microstructure with Ce doping. Fig. 2b shows that CoOx(Ce) is amorphous, with only some evidence of short-range ordering in the film. The structure difference was also suggested by selective area electron diffraction (SAED). The SAED pattern of CoOx (Fig. 2c) shows strong diffraction rings, and some diffraction spots can be found, which suggests the crystalline nature of CoOx. In contrast, the SAED pattern of CoOx(Ce) (Fig. 2d) has only wide and weak diffraction rings, which suggests the weak crystallinity of CoOx(Ce) in comparison with that of CoOx. The reciprocal distance (q) – intensity relationships (Fig. 2e) were derived from the rotation average of the SAED patterns of CoOx(Ce) and CoOx. The resultant patterns are analogous to cubic Co3O4 (JCPDS no. 80-1537, a = 8.16370 Å). It is therefore suggested that the grain lattice in CoOx and the short-range ordering in CoOx(Ce) would be allocated to a cubic structure. The wide full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the pattern of CoOx(Ce) is in accordance with the amorphous structure shown by TEM. No patterns from CeOx can be found in the SAED pattern of CoOx(Ce), which can be ascribed to a small content of Ce in the resultant film. The distribution of Ce in the CoOx(Ce) film can be suggested by EDS elemental mapping in TEM. Fig. 2f shows a scanning TEM (STEM) image of CoOx(Ce), and the corresponding element mappings of Co (Fig. 2g), Ce (Fig. 2h), and O (Fig. 2i) show the homogenous distribution of Ce in CoOx(Ce).\nRaman spectra of CoOx(Ce) and Co3O4 were measured to confirm their structure. The spectra are shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.† Raman spectrum of CoOx shows three distinct peaks, which can be assigned to A1g (693 cm−1), F2g (523 cm−1), and Eg (479 cm−1) phonon modes of Co3O4.24 The peaks were shifted to smaller wavenumbers in the spectrum of CoOx(Ce), located at 673 and 451 cm−1. The redshift of Raman peaks suggests a weaker bond strength in CoOx(Ce), in accordance with the disorder of lattice in amorphous CoOx(Ce).25\nThe catalytic activity of the CoOx(Ce) film was evaluated by electrochemical measurements. The experiments were carried out in an aqueous solution (KOH, 1 M) using a three-electrode configuration. A graphite rod was adopted as the counter electrode. All measured potentials were corrected with iR drop, and referenced to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential. Fig. 3a shows the polarization curves of CoOx(Ce), CoOx, RuO2, and bare CFP. It is shown that the faradaic current of the bare CFP is negligible in comparison with that of CoOx(Ce) and CoOx in the potential range of 1.2 to 1.6 V vs. RHE. RuO2 is one of the most active electrocatalysts for the OER. RuO2 nanoparticles were loaded onto the surface of CFP with the loading amount of 1.1 mg cm−2, the same amount as that of CoOx(Ce). The synthesis conditions of the CoOx(Ce) film were varied to investigate their influence on the performance of CoOx(Ce). Comparative samples include those synthesized at different deposition temperatures and with different concentrations of Ce in the precursor. The polarization curves of comparative samples were plotted and are shown in Fig. S5 in the ESI,† and confirm that the sample shown in Fig. 3a is the best one among all the CoOx(Ce) films.\nThe onset overpotential (ηon) is defined to be the overpotential required to drive a current density of 1 mA cm−2, and ηon is as small as 85 mV for CoOx(Ce). The η20 and η100 are defined as the overpotential that produces a current density of 20 and 100 mA cm−2, respectively, and used as indicators to compare the performance of various OER electrocatalysts. The η20 is usually used to evaluate the promising application of an OER electrocatalyst in solar-driven water splitting because typical solar photovoltaic devices produce current density of 10–20 mA cm−1.26 Moreover, the η100 indicates the capability of an OER electrocatalyst in industrial water electrolysis. The η20 is 261 mV and the η100 is 302 mV for CoOx(Ce). Both the values are smaller than the corresponding overpotentials of RuO2 (η20 = 265 mV and η100 = 320 mV), which suggests superb catalytic activity of the CoOx(Ce) film in the OER. Meanwhile, the polarization curve of CoOx film indicates an η20 of 327 mV and an η100 of 358 mV. It is explicitly demonstrated that the Ce doping remarkably enhances the catalytic activity of CoOx during the OER.\nTafel slopes of CoOx(Ce), CoOx, and RuO2 were derived from the corresponding polarization curves by data fitting (Fig. 3b). The Tafel slope of the CoOx(Ce) film is 65.67 mV dec−1, which is smaller than those of CoOx (246.7 mV dec−1) and RuO2 (82.87 mV dec−1). The smaller Tafel slope of CoOx(Ce) indicates the faster increase in current with overpotential, and thus a faster surface reaction kinetics.\nThe performance of CoOx(Ce) is competitive to those of other cerium modified OER electrocatalysts, e.g., CeO2/CoSe2 (η20 = 324 mV),17 FeOOH/CeO2 (η20 = 246 mV),18 CeOx/CoS (η10 = 269 mV),23 Ce–NiO (η10 = 382 mV),19 Ni(OH)2–CeO2 (η20 = 282 mV),21 and CeOx/CoOx (η10 = 313 mV).22 A detailed comparison of the performance of CoOx(Ce) with those of recently reported cobalt-based OER electrocatalysts can be found in Table S1 in the ESI.† The η20 and η100 CoOx(Ce) are competitive to corresponding values of most reported non-precious metal OER electrocatalysts.\nThe long-term stability of OER electrocatalysts is necessary in practical applications. The CoOx(Ce) can stably maintain its capability in catalysing the OER in long-term water electrolysis. The long-term stability of CoOx(Ce) is demonstrated by chronoamperometry (Fig. 3c). CoOx(Ce) maintained a large and stable current density of 60 mA cm−2 for 40 hours. Fluctuations in the current density can be found, which would be possibly associated to day/night temperature fluctuations during long-term measurements and/or the generation and release of gas bubbles on the surface of the sample, a process varying real-time effective surface area of CoOx(Ce). The polarization curves measured before and after the potentiostatic electrolysis are shown as the inset of Fig. 3c. The overlap of the two polarization curves confirms that the performance of CoOx(Ce) was maintained after long-term electrocatalysis.\nIn order to detect the Faraday efficiency of the CoOx(Ce) film, potentiostatic electrolysis was carried out in 1 M KOH for 1200 s, and the volume of collected oxygen bubbles was recorded and plotted in Fig. 3d. A comparison of the theoretical volume with the experimentally generated oxygen volume indicates that the Faraday efficiency of CoOx(Ce) is 92%, which confirms that most of the charge is converted to oxygen by the OER through the CoOx(Ce).\nElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of CoOx(Ce) and CoOx was used to understand the reaction kinetics during the OER. The results are shown in the Nyquist curve in Fig. 4a, where the data are fitted using an equivalent circuit shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† The semicircle in the low frequency range is related to the faradaic process (OER) on the electrocatalyst surface. The corresponding resistance element is charge transfer resistance (Rct). Rct is usually used as an indicator of OER kinetics, and a smaller Rct corresponds to a faster OER process. Fig. 4a clearly shows that the low frequency semicircle that corresponds to CoOx(Ce) has the smaller diameter than that of CoOx. Correspondingly, the Rct of CoOx(Ce) was 15.2 Ω, much smaller than that of CoOx (70.8 Ω). The smaller Rct of CoOx(Ce) is in good accordance with its superior performance in OER in comparison with that of CoOx.\nIn general, the catalytic activity of an electrocatalyst is associated with the intrinsic activity of active sites, the amount of active sites, and electron transport that transfers electrons between the active sites and the current collector. The electron transport resistance (Ret) reflects the electron transport ability, a smaller Ret being necessary for better performance. Here Ret is estimated from the EIS spectra by the equation: Ret = R1 + Rs, where R1 and Rs are the resistive elements in the equivalent circuit. The Ret of CoOx(Ce) is 5.775 Ω, which is smaller than that of CoOx (6.715 Ω). The introduction of Ce is therefore beneficial for the electron transport from the current collector to the surface of the electrocatalyst.\nThe number of active sites is associated with the ECSA of the samples. The ECSA is estimated from the electrochemical double layer capacitance (Cdl) of the corresponding samples by the equation ECSA = Cdl/Cs. Cs is the specific capacitance of a flat surface with 1 cm2 of real surface area, with a typical value between 20 to 60 μF cm−2. A Cs of 40 μF cm−2 is used to estimate the ECSA in our experiment. The Cdl values of the different samples were calculated from the corresponding cyclic voltammetry (CV) scans (Fig. S7 in the ESI†) shown in Fig. 4b. Accordingly, CoOx(Ce) has a ECSA of 2.14 × 104 cm2, and the ECSA of CoOx is 7.88 × 103 cm2. The ECSA of CoOx(Ce) is 2.75 times that of CoOx, which demonstrates that the amorphourization induced by the Ce doping can remarkably enlarge the ECSA of CoOx. We notice that the ECSA (or Cdl) of both CoOx(Ce) and CoOx are larger than the typically reported values of cobalt oxide, e.g. CoOx@CN (Cdl = 37.4 mF cm−2),27 phosphorus modified Co3O4 (Cdl = 68.7 mF cm−2),28 and plasma-engraved Co3O4 nanosheets (Cdl = 94.97 mF cm−2).29 The much larger ECSA of CoOx(Ce) and CoOx is associated to their morphological and structural features. The CoOx particles have a small size (3.2 ± 0.9 nm), and CoOx(Ce) is amorphous; both are beneficial for the exposure of surface unsaturated bonds and therefore the large ECSA.\nTurnover frequency (TOF) is an indicator for the evaluation of intrinsic activity of an electrocatalyst. The TOF is theoretically defined by the turnover on each active site on the surface of an electrocatalyst, whereas, in practice, the TOF was usually computed by assuming that all of the metal atoms in the electrocatalyst contribute to the catalytic process.30,31 This assumption is associated with the practical difficulty in defining the active sites of an electrocatalyst and computing the number of active sites in nanoparticles without a well-defined facet. Therefore, the resultant TOF value is indeed a mass-averaged activity of electrocatalyst. However, electrocatalysis is a surface process. Therefore, it is more reasonable to use surface–average activity as an indicator of the intrinsic activity of an electrocatalyst. With a known ECSA, the intrinsic catalytic activity can be derived by normalizing the polarization curve with ECSA, the resultant current density being denoted as JECSA. The comparison of JECSA between CoOx(Ce) and CoOx can be found in Fig. 4c. Under the same overpotential, the JECSA of CoOx(Ce) is always larger than that of CoOx, which suggests that CoOx(Ce) exhibits a much more efficient intrinsic activity in the OER in comparison with that of CoOx.\nThe superior performance of CoOx(Ce) is therefore associated to its smaller Ret, larger ECSA, and faster reaction kinetics on active sites. TEM characterization has shown that the grain size of CoOx is 3.2 ± 0.9 nm, while CoOx(Ce) is amorphous. Amorphous structure means that the material has more dangling bonds in comparison with crystalline particles, and is thus expected to expose more active sites.13 Therefore, crystal structure is a possible origin of difference in ECSA. Moreover, it will be introduced below that Ce doping would bring a new kind of oxygen vacancy, which can also contribute to larger ECSA.\nThe apparent activation energy of the OER was determined by an Arrhenius plot: log(j) = −0.434Ea/(RT) + const, where R is the Boltzmann constant (8.315 J g−1 mol−1 K−1) and Ea is the activation energy expressed in J g−1 mol−1. Temperature related polarization curves of CoOx(Ce) and CoOx are shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI,† and the corresponding Arrhenius plot at η = 150 mV can be found in Fig. 4d. The Ea is 2.68 kJ mol−1 for CoOx(Ce) and 11.1 kJ mol−1 for CoOx. CoOx(Ce) has a smaller barrier height in the OER than CoOx.\nX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to monitor the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts. Fig. 5 shows the XPS spectra of the Co 2p, O 1s, and Ce 3d window that correspond to the CoOx(Ce), CoOx, and CeOx samples. CoOx shows a doublet (Co1) at the binding energy (BE) of 781.5 eV (Co 2p3/2) and 797.6 eV (Co 2p1/2). This doublet can be allocated to Co2+ in CoOx.29 The doublet that is labelled as Co2 is the satellite peak. Although SAED shows that the crystal structure of CoOx can be assigned to cubic Co3O4, the Co3+ species that is usually found in Co3O4 cannot be detected here. The absence of Co3+ would be associated with a relatively small size of CoOx (3.2 ± 0.9 nm), which results in abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of CoOx. The presence of an oxygen vacancy can also be suggested by the O 1s window in the XPS spectrum. Two peaks can be found from the O 1s spectrum of CoOx, located at 531.9 (O2) and 532.7 eV (O3). The peak O2 can be indexed to an oxygen vacancy in the CoOx lattice,29 and the peak O3 comes from oxygen in the adsorbed water molecule.32 Meanwhile, a peak near 529.8 eV that is usually attributed to lattice Co–O29 is absent in the O 1s spectrum of CoOx, which indicates that oxygen vacancies prevail in CoOx. The decrease in the intensity of the Co3+ signal in the XPS spectrum of oxygen-vacancy-contained Co3O4 was also reported by other groups.29,33,34\nWith the introduction of Ce, the Co 2p spectrum of CoOx(Ce) is identical to that of CoOx. The doublet Co1 of CoOx(Ce) is located at 781.5 eV and 797.6 eV. The introduction of Ce does not modify the chemical state of cobalt. However, the O 1s spectrum of CoOx(Ce) shows four peaks. With the aid of the O 1s spectra of CoOx and CeOx, peak O1 (530.0 eV) comes from oxygen that is bonded to Ce, peak O2 is associated to an oxygen defect in CoOx, O3 is related to water adsorbed on the CoOx or Ce component, and O4 (534.5 eV) is a new peak that cannot be found in pristine CoOx or CeOx. Since the electronic structure of Co does not vary after the introduction of Ce, the new O4 peak would come from oxygen near the Ce atoms. The Ce 3d spectra of CoOx(Ce) and CeOx show 4 doublets. Peak Ce1 (882.5 eV), Ce3 (888.6 eV), and Ce4 (899.1 eV) can be assigned to the Ce4+ species and Ce2 (885.0 eV) to the Ce3+ species.35 The comparison between the Ce 3d spectra of CoOx(Ce) and CeOx shows that the Ce species in CoOx(Ce) has a larger portion of Ce3+ atoms in comparison with the Ce species in CeOx. Therefore, fewer oxygen atoms are bonded to Ce in CoOx(Ce) in comparison with those in CeOx. This means that the oxygen vacancies are introduced at the periphery of Ce atoms in CoOx(Ce). Consequently, the binding energy of O shifts positively to peak O4 in the O 1s spectrum of CoOx(Ce).\nBy the comparison of the XPS spectra of CoOx(Ce), CoOx, and CeOx, it is shown that although the introduction of Ce does not induce the electronic structure variation of Co, Ce can introduce new oxygen vacancies. This effect is different from the result that the introduction of Ce induced the partial reduction of the metal species (e.g. iron,18 nickel,19,21 cobalt,17,23 and copper35) in corresponding host compounds. The difference might be associated to the structure of CoOx(Ce) and CoOx. CoOx has a relatively small particle size (3.2 ± 0.9 nm diameter) and CoOx(Ce) is amorphous; both results in the absence of high valence state cobalt (Co3+) in the sample. In this case, it is hard to further reduce Co2+ by Ce. The results shown herein demonstrate that even the chemical state of cobalt is not influenced by Ce doping; the Ce doping can introduce a new kind of oxygen vacancy and remarkably promote the catalytic activity of CoOx in the OER.\nThe content of the oxygen vacancy with respect to all oxygen species was computed. The content of oxygen vacancy is 63% in CoOx and 48% in CoOx(Ce). The area ratio of peak O2 (oxygen vacancy in the CoOx component) to peak O3 (oxygen from adsorbed water) decreased after the introduction of Ce, which suggests that the amount of adsorbed water increases with Ce doping. Furthermore, Ce doping also bonds oxygen atoms to Ce atoms. These two factors increase the total amount of non-defective oxygen, and therefore decrease the content of oxygen vacancies. The atomic ratio of the oxygen vacancy to the Co species was also estimated by the ratio of the area of peaks allocated to oxygen vacancy (O2 and O4) and that to Co (Co1 and Co2). This ratio is 78% for CoOx and 45% for CoOx(Ce). It was shown that the total amount of oxygen vacancies decreased, although the new O4 vacancy was introduced. Accordingly, it is suggested that the O4 vacancy is more efficient in catalysing OER in comparison with O2 vacancy.\nThe post-OER CoOx(Ce) sample was subjected to XPS and TEM measurements. TEM images show that the sample remains amorphous (Fig. S9a and b in the ESI†). The corresponding SAED rings (Fig. S9c†) are analogous to those of pristine CoOx(Ce) (Fig. S9d in the ESI†). Meanwhile, EDS mapping (panel f to h of Fig. S9 in the ESI†) shows the homogenous distribution of Ce in the post-OER sample. XPS spectra of the post-OER sample can be found in Fig. S10 in the ESI.† Co 2p window shows a new peak at 780.5 eV (denoted as Co3), which can be assigned to Co2+.28 Meanwhile, the Co1 peak at 0.3 eV positively shifts to 781.8 eV, and the satellite peak Co2 shifts to 790.2 eV. The positive shift of Co2+ indicates the minor oxidation of the Co species after OER measurement. Meanwhile, the intensity of peak O4 in the post-OER sample becomes weaker in the O 1s window in comparison with that of the pristine CoOx(Ce). It is therefore suggested that the defects associated to Ce3+ decrease after OER measurement. This decrease can be attributed to the oxidation of Ce3+ during OER because the Ce 3d window of the XPS spectrum shows the decrease in the intensity of the Ce2 peak (Ce3+).', '3. Conclusion': '', '4.
